# News-Keyword-Similarity
Using NLP to scrape news articles for specified keywords, analysing semantic distances using word embeddings (GloVe), and visualising keyword relationships through heatmaps and bar charts. Built with BeautifulSoup, Gensim, OpenPyXL, and Seaborn.

My program initially uses the BBC search functionality and enters the keyword in question as the search parameter. It then stores the relevant BBC News articles that the BBC search returns. Then, it navigates to each of these article URLs and grabs the contents of the article, and stores them to a file. The program only stores the raw article data to the file and strips out any HTML that exists on the web page. The final result is that, for every keyword, a file called ```[keyword].txt``` is created, which contains an amalgamation of the contents of every BBC News article that has been collected from BBC that corresponds to that keyword. The image below shows the number of articles that were collected per keyword, when the program was run on 23rd April 2021. Note that any data in this report is subject to change depending on the behaviour of the BBC search functionality, so the data below is just an example of possible results. It is worth noting that for ‘Advanced Persistent Threat’, ‘spyware’, and especially ‘malicious bot’, the number of relevant news articles that BBC returned when these keywords were entered as the search parameter is significantly lower than others.
