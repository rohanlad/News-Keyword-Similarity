Gmail 'safer than parliament's email system' says Tory MP By Cristina Criddle 13 April Google's email service - Gmail - is “more secure” than parliament's email system, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee has claimed. Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he has repeatedly been the focus of cyber attacks over the past three years. Hackers have tried to access his account and sent emails impersonating him, he told the BBC. The Tory MP believes China and Iran were behind some of these attempts. “I was told by friends at GCHQ that I was better off sticking to Gmail, rather than using the parliamentary system, because it was more secure,” said Mr Tugendhat. “Frankly, that tells you the level of security and the priority we're giving to democracy in the United Kingdom.” A spokeswoman said the parliamentary email system "offers significantly higher levels of security than external providers". The National Cyber Security Centre said that MPs should continue to use the parliamentary email system. Mr Tugendhat is one of a number of British politicians being sanctioned by China over what it sees as the spreading of “lies and disinformation” about human rights abuses of the Uyghur population in the Xinjiang region of China. WATCH: 'Mass murder' fear for China's Muslim Uighurs The sanctions ban Mr Tugendhat, who leads the China Research Group with fellow Conservative Neil O'Brien, from travelling to China. “In the last week, emails were sent around claiming to be from me - claiming that I'd resigned from the foreign affairs committee." He added "many other cyber attacks have been perpetrated either on me or on others" and implied the attacks were connected to the recent sanctions by China Tarah Wheeler, a cyber-security fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, described Gmail as "a very safe email choice”, but said an Advanced Protection Programme - with a security key and multi-factor authentication - should be in place to ensure the highest level of security. “It’s what I, and many other security professionals, use for our email and recommend to family members." Usability is often prioritised by governments and “sometimes security becomes an expensive after-thought”, she added. “The IT administrators who work to balance all those things are often underfunded - and supporting them is incredibly important to increasing the security of governmental systems.” Technology explained: What is phishing? But Dr Stephanie Hare, a technology researcher, said parliament should have “much greater security than Gmail". “I am not surprised to hear that MPs' email accounts are targeted - that is to be expected. “All systems are vulnerable, but we would want to see the highest possible security for the email systems used by our elected officials, in order to protect our democracy," she said.Twitter hack: Staff tricked by phone spear-phishing scam 31 July 2020 The unprecedented hacking of celebrity Twitter accounts this month was caused by human error and a spear-phishing attack on Twitter employees, the company has confirmed. Spear-phishing is a targeted attack designed to trick people into handing out information such as passwords. Twitter said its staff were targeted through their phones. The successful attempt let attackers tweet from celebrity accounts and access their private direct messages. The accounts of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and reality star Kim Kardashian West were compromised, and shared a Bitcoin scam. It reportedly netted the scammers more than $100,000 (£80,000). The attack has raised concerns about the level of access that Twitter employees, and subsequently the hackers, have to user accounts. By obtaining employee credentials, they were able to target specific employees who had access to our account support tools. They then targeted 130 Twitter accounts - Tweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and downloading the Twitter Data of 7. — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) July 31, 2020 View original tweet on Twitter Twitter acknowledged that concern in its statement, saying that it was "taking a hard look" at how it could improve its permissions and processes. "Access to these tools is strictly limited and is only granted for valid business reasons," the company said. Not all the employees targeted in the spear-phishing attack had access to the in-house tools, Twitter said - but they did have access to the internal network and other systems. Once the attackers had acquired user credentials to let them inside Twitter's network, the next stage of their attack was much easier. They targeted other employees who had access to account controls. Analysis By Joe Tidy, cyber-security reporter Twitter isn't clarifying whether or not their employees were duped by an email or a phone call. The consensus in the information security community is that it was the latter. Phonecall spear-phishing, commonly known as vishing, is bread and butter for the sort of hackers who are suspected of this attack. The criminals obtained the phone numbers of a handful of Twitter staff and, by using friendly persuasion and trickery, got them to hand over usernames and passwords that gave them an initial foothold into the internal system. As Twitter puts it, the scammers "exploited human vulnerabilities". You can imagine how it possibly went: Hacker to Twitter employee: "Hi, I'm new to the department and I've locked myself out of the Twitter internal portal, can you do me a huge favour and give me the login again?" The fact that Twitter staff were susceptible to these basic attacks is embarrassing for a company built on being at the forefront of digital technology and internet culture. Twitter said the initial spear-phishing attempt happened on 15 July - the same day the accounts were compromised, suggesting the accounts were accessed within hours. "This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems," the company said. "This was a striking reminder of how important each person on our team is in protecting our service." Technology explained: What is phishing? Twitter did not state whether the attack involved voice calls, despite a previous report from Bloomberg stating that at least one Twitter employee was contacted by attackers through a phone call. Phishing is most commonly done by email and text message, encouraging recipients to click on links that take them to websites with fake log-in screens. Spear-phishing is a version of the scam targeted at one person or a specific company, and is usually heavily customised to make it more believable. One victim whose account was compromised told the BBC there were several things Twitter could have done differently. "They shouldn't give the ability to a single employee to remove both email address on file and two-factor authentication," they said. "I understand why there's a need for this - for example if a dormant account has a very old email that's inaccessible and you've lost your phone or something-  but it should require two employees to sign off." They also said communication from Twitter was poor. "It took 10 days to reset this account with no actual personal response from Twitter. I literally got a 'click here to continue' automated email from their system when they added my email back to the account to allow me to reset it - and it looked like a phishing email."Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks? By Mary-Ann Russon 8 April Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks. Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years. Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware. However, the new report comes on the back of a recent significant security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system . And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with. So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried? How a firmware attack works Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC. Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers. This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system. Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware. "People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things," explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter. Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security. "Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot." A screenshot of the RobbinHood ransomware There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as RobbinHood , a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019 . Another example is Thunderspy , an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other. This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep. "If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible," explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes. "Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more." Big organisations beware The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops). "It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware," he tells the BBC. Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software, because they only make money if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users. Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem. The pandemic has led to a sharp rise in devices connecting remotely to critical corporate network infrastructure The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws. The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years. Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity. Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data. Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds. "This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do." Creeping soon to a network near you Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole, to pay attention to hardware security . Hardware and firmware designers need to be included in the cyber-security discussion, say experts "Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack," says Mr Boyd. "It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected." Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of "budding hardware enthusiasts" who have been learning their way around firmware by "modding video game consoles over the last decade" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger. "Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies," says Mr Potter. "As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it."Obinwanne Okeke: Nigerian email fraudster jailed for 10 years in US 17 February US authorities accused Okeke of using "subterfuge and impersonation" to lure his victims A Nigerian businessman, who once appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine, has been jailed for 10 years in the US over a cyber fraud scam that led to the theft of about $11m (£8m). Obinwanne Okeke, also known as Invictus Obi, used Nigerian-based companies to defraud people in the US. His companies used phishing emails to steal funds from victims. In 2016 Forbes Africa listed Okeke among the most influential businesspeople under the age of 30. From around 2015 to 2019, he was part of a group which engaged in a conspiracy to conduct various computer-based frauds, including creating fake websites , the US Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia said in a statement after he was sentenced. It added that the 33-year-old, who was arrested two years ago, used "subterfuge and impersonation" to lure his victims. Okeke's Invictus Group companies were also accused of working with conspirators to create profiles of hundreds of victims including people in the US's Eastern District of Virginia. Online scamming: 'If it doesn't look right, don't trust it' In one phishing attack in 2018 the fraudsters managed to gain access to the email of a manager at Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar's heavy industrial and farm equipment. They made fraudulent wire transfers to the value of nearly $11m, and moved the funds overseas. Okeke's sentencing demonstrated the US authorities' determination to pursue international cybercriminals no matter where they committed their crimes, said the statement from the Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia.Police warn students to avoid science website By Sean Coughlan 19 March Police have warned students in the UK against using a website that they say lets users "illegally access" millions of scientific research papers. The City of London police's Intellectual Property Crime Unit says using the Sci-Hub website could "pose a threat" to students' personal data. The police are concerned that users of the "Russia-based website" could have information taken and misused online. The Sci-Hub website says it "removes all barriers" to science. It offers open access to more than 85 million scientific papers and claims that copyright laws should be abolished and that such material should be "knowledge to all". It describes itself as "the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers". University 'threat' But Max Bruce, the City of London police's cyber protection officer, has urged universities to block the website on their networks because of the "threat posed by Sci-Hub to both the university and its students". "If you're tricked into revealing your log-in credentials, whether it's through the use of fake emails or malware, we know that Sci-Hub will then use those details to compromise your university's computer network in order to steal research papers," he said. The City of London Police, which is the national lead for fraud, has warned that students studying online at home might be vulnerable. "Students should be aware that accessing such websites is illegal, as it hosts stolen intellectual property," said Det Insp Kevin Ives. He warned that visitors to the website, whose Twitter account has been suspended, are "very vulnerable to having their credentials stolen". 'Access to research' The police warning says scientific papers could have been obtained by a "variety of malicious means, such as the use of phishing emails to trick university staff and students into divulging their login credentials". But the Sci-Hub website has previously told the BBC that it provides students with access to research papers for which the subscriptions are "very expensive". Andrew Pitts, chief executive of the PSI Registry, which highlights "academic piracy", has warned that users "may inadvertently download potentially dangerous content from this illegal site and put the security of their organisations at risk". The National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ intelligence service, has warned of the threat of cyber-attacks against universities. Last autumn the cyber-agency warned of online attacks attempting to "derail" the start of the academic year in universities.Fraudsters stepped up efforts in new year, HMRC figures show 24 February Scam attempts by fraudsters masquerading as the UK's tax authority surged as potential victims completed tax returns while staying at home. Con-artists attempted to take advantage of the self-assessment filing deadline at the end of January to flood people with fake texts, emails and calls. They posed as HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials and attempted to steal personal financial details. Phone scam reports to HMRC tripled compared with December, it said. There were a total of 33,053 reports in January, in addition to 46,210 phishing emails, and 26,643 suspicious text messages during the same month. The number of bogus text message reports was twice the next highest level seen during any month of the last year. Types of scams Most of these scam messages offered bogus tax rebates, fake support or grants, or threatened legal action over unpaid tax. A new scam involved criminals calling people saying that their national insurance number had been used fraudulently. This was a lie. An HMRC spokesman said: "If someone calls, emails or texts claiming to be from HMRC, saying that you can claim financial help, are due a tax refund or owe tax, or asks for bank or other personal details, it might be a scam. "If you can't verify the identity of the caller, HMRC recommends that you do not speak to them."Newcastle school targeted in fees phishing scam 20 January 2019 Royal Grammar School in Newcastle was one of a number of schools targeted in the cyber attack Fee-paying schools were targeted in a cyber attack which accessed parents' email addresses, it has emerged. Fraudulent emails sent from school accounts offered a 25% discount on fees for paying quickly via the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Newcastle's Royal Grammar School warned parents of the "sophisticated attack". It has been approached for comment. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said other schools had been targeted and it was investigating. In an email to parents, the grammar school's headmaster, John Fern, said it had reported the attack to police. Because of the "potential breach of data" in the use of parent's email contacts, it is also liaising with the ICO. The email requesting payment spelled cryptocurrency incorrectly This is required under the General Data Protection Regulation. The emails, which included spelling, grammatical and punctuation errors, were sent on 29 December from the address of the school's bursar, who is responsible for fees. The school told parents it was working with the company that provides its email systems, iSAMS, to "establish exactly what happened". ISAMS said it would be issuing a statement. Mr Fern told parents the school would "never ask for money or bank details in this way" and apologised. No financial details were accessed, he added. The ICO did not provide details of how many schools were affected but said: "[We are] aware of other phishing type attacks that have been targeted towards schools. "Royal Grammar School has made us aware of an incident and we will assess the information provided."Npower app attack exposed customers' bank details 25 February Energy firm Npower has closed down its app following an attack that exposed some customers' financial and personal information. Contact details, birth dates, addresses and partial bank account numbers are among details believed stolen. The firm did not say how many accounts were affected by the breach, which was first reported by MoneySavingExpert.com . But the affected accounts had been locked, Npower told the BBC. "We identified suspicious cyber-activity affecting the Npower mobile app, where someone has accessed customer accounts using login data stolen from another website. This is known as 'credential stuffing'," the firm said in a statement. "We've contacted all affected customers to make them aware of the issue, encouraging them to change their passwords and offering advice on how to prevent unauthorised access to their online account." It also advised customers to change passwords on other accounts if using the same one. It added that the mobile app had already been due to be shut down as part of wind-down plans following Npower's acquisition by Eon. The Information Commissioner's Office confirmed that it had been informed about the hack. "Npower has made us aware of an incident affecting their app and we are making enquiries," the ICO told the BBC. It is not clear when the attack took place, but MoneySavingExpert said it had seen an email sent to customers at the beginning of the month warning that their accounts had been locked. Action Fraud advised customers to keep an eye out for potential phishing emails and to monitor their bank accounts for suspicious activity.Emotet botnet taken down by international police swoop 27 January Police have seized thousands of computers running one of the most dangerous hacking networks worldwide. The Emotet network obtains access to victims' computers, via malicious email attachments, then sells it to criminals who install more dangerous malware. Police from the UK, EU, US and Canada worked together to "disrupt" Emotet. Europol called it "one of most significant botnets of the past decade" and one of the main " door openers " for computer systems worldwide. "Once this unauthorised access was established, these were sold to other top-level criminal groups to deploy further illicit activities such data theft and extortion through ransomware," it said. Bye-bye botnets👋 Huge global operation brings down the world's most dangerous malware. Investigators have taken control of the Emotet botnet, the most resilient malware in the wild. Get the full story: https://t.co/NMrBqmhMIf  pic.twitter.com/K28A6ixxuM — Europol (@Europol) January 27, 2021 View original tweet on Twitter Dmitry Smilyanets, from Recorded Future, said: "Even if the creator and his support and operators are not arrested, they likely will not try to rebuild. "They have enough cash to retire in peace - or start a new criminal adventure. "A working botnet is a very complicated and gentle system. "If more than a half of the infrastructure is not working, it's safe to say bye-bye." 'Enable Macros' Emotet was initially a banking trojan, designed to spy on victims' computers and steal login details. Victims would receive an apparently important Word document marked for their attention. When opened, it would ask them to "enable Macros" - a seemingly innocent feature built into Microsoft Word that actually opened their computer up to attackers. Lotem Finkelstein, of Check Point Software, said it had been tracking Emotet for years. "The most successful and prevalent malware of 2020 by a long way", he said, it had, over the course of the year, sent phishing emails with more than 150,000 different subject lines and 100,000 file names for the attachments. "It constantly adjusted its phishing emails to victims' interests and global events - for example, the Covid-19 pandemic or major shopping seasons such as Black Friday," Mr Finkelstein said. And although the Europol announcement may seem "abstract", it would protect "the public from cyber-threats that have caused losses of millions, if not more, of dollars".Just Eat 'phishing' scammer faces jail By Gaetan Portal 2 May 2018 The moment a group of undercover police arrested Grant West on a train A computer hacker who sold the personal data of thousands of people on the dark web faces jail after admitting a string of offences. Police began investigating Grant West, 26, after he conned details from Just Eat customers in 2015. The personal data of around 165,000 people was compromised. Detectives later found he had 63,000 credit and debit card details - and seized more than £500,000 in bitcoins belonging to West. He admitted charges including conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offences. West, from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, used "phishing" emails to extract customer data from various companies. Between July 2015 and December 2015 he targeted online food delivery firm Just Eat, using a scam in which customers received a bogus email offering a voucher in return for answering questions about the service. Grant West sent fake emails to customers offering vouchers The emails allowed West to harvest information - including customers' names, addresses and payment card details - in order to sell to other criminals. There is no suggestion that Just Eat's own computer systems were hacked or compromised. Detectives believe he targeted customers of just about every major online vendor, from "Argos to Uber", as part of his criminal enterprise, using millions of email addresses to indiscriminately trick people into revealing their financial information. Once he had a complete set of customer details he would sell them on via the now-defunct online dark web market Alpha Bay, with the user name "courvoisier". The details were sold as "Fullz" - a slang term on the dark web used to describe a full set of customer details that would allow others to defraud individual bank accounts and credit cards. West would ask Just Eat customers to answer questions about the service The courvoisier account sold details belonging to 9,627 people - many of whom lost significant amounts to other online fraudsters. Police say West made more than £180,000 from the scam. The proceeds from his business were converted into Bitcoins and stored in multiple accounts. The Just Eat phishing scam cost the firm more than £200,000 - but also gave specialist detectives from London's Metropolitan Police their first lead. West used his girlfriend's laptop and police traced the computer via a series of IP addresses, despite his best efforts to cover his digital tracks. As detectives moved in on West they realised that getting their hands on the laptop with his "fingers on the keyboard" was crucial. A team of covert officers tracked West and while he was using the computer in the first class carriage on a train from Rhyl to London officers pounced on him, seizing the unlocked computer. The arrest was captured on the train's CCTV. On the laptop they found the financial information of more than 100,000 people. The dark web page used by West Officers also raided West's home address and found an SD card with the details of 63,000 debit and credit cards, seven million email addresses with passwords, and the details of more than 500 companies - all the components required to commit mass online fraud. They also seized £25,000 in cash and half a kilogram of cannabis. As well as financial information, West also sold cannabis online - which he shipped to customers - and "how to" guides for fellow hackers. Police say West treated his fraudulent activity as a "day job", sometimes spending 18 hours a day hacking financial information and doing online deals. At first sight his lifestyle was simple - the family home was a caravan in a residential park - but West funded luxury holidays and goods with stolen credit card details. His former girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, 26, from North Wales, also enjoyed the cash generated by the frauds. At one point using stolen details to buy a new bikini. She was sentenced on Wednesday to a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorised access of computer material. His Honour Judge Michael Gledhill QC told Ms Brookes that she was "very fortunate indeed" not to be jailed and said of her relationship with West that she had "fallen into the arms of a villain and a rogue". West used his girlfriend Rachael Brookes' laptop for his criminal activities West has no formal qualifications and, although he directed the frauds, investigators believe he was working with others. Bitcoin "wallets" belonging to West were emptied the day after he was arrested. At current prices those Bitcoins are estimated to be worth £1.5m. Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gallagher - who led the investigation - said police were "uncovering the darkness and shady areas" where criminals operate on the dark web, and were "bringing them into the light". "There was a myth that Bitcoin in particular, and crypto-currencies more generally, was anonymous and it was also a myth that people can operate with impunity on the dark web and remain anonymous," he said. A spokesperson for Just Eat said "We were made aware of a phishing scam which took place in 2015 and at the time took steps to mitigate this… at no point were Just Eat systems compromised or breached. "Protecting our brand and our customers from online fraud is of utmost importance to us." West will be sentenced on 25 May. Correction 19 September 2018: This article has been amended to remove any suggestion that Just Eat's own computer systems were hacked or compromised.Just Eat 'phishing' scammer Grant West jailed 25 May 2018 Grant West sent fake emails to customers offering vouchers A computer hacker found with the personal data of about 165,000 people and described as a "one man cyber crime wave" has been jailed. Grant West, 26, from Sheerness in Kent, sent "phishing" emails pretending to be from Just Eat and extracted the details of 63,000 credit and debit cards. He admitted charges including conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offences on 2 May. Judge Michael Gledhill jailed West for 10 years and eight months. West carried out cyber attacks on high street names including Sainsbury's, Asda, Uber, Argos and bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral to obtain email addresses. Between July 2015 and December 2015 he sent customers scam emails masquerading as takeaway service Just East, offering a voucher in return for answering questions. Sold on dark web Once he had a complete set of customer details he would sell them on via the now-defunct online dark web market Alpha Bay. The prosecution said a total of £84,000 was taken fraudulently from accounts held at Barclays, costing the bank more than £300,000 to remedy. British Airways also suffered a £400,000 loss after Avios accounts were hacked. West got Just Eat customers' information by asking them to answer questions about the service The judge described West as "a one man cyber crime wave" and said £1.6m worth of cryptocurrency, which he made selling people's information on the dark web, is unaccounted for. He said: "When such inadequate security is confronted with a criminal of your skills and ambition it is totally unfit for purpose and worthless. "This case should be a wake-up call to customers, companies and the computer industry to the very real threat of cyber crime." The Met Police said West made more than £180,000 from the scam with the proceeds being converted into Bitcoins and stored in multiple accounts. The Just Eat phishing scam cost the firm more than £200,000, but there was no suggestion its own computer systems had been hacked or compromised, the court heard. West used his girlfriend's laptop on which police found the financial information of more than 100,000 people. The moment a group of undercover police arrested Grant West on a train When officers raided West's home address they found an SD card with the details of 63,000 debit and credit cards. It also contained seven million email addresses with passwords, and the details of more than 500 companies. Police also seized £25,000 in cash, more than £500,000 in bitcoins and half a kilogram of cannabis. West's former girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, 26, from North Wales, was given a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorised access of computer material.Covid: Warnings over vaccine email scam 28 January The fake emails purporting to be from the NHS can look convincing at first glance A woman who received a fake email offering her a coronavirus vaccination has criticised "horrible" fraudsters for preying on the vulnerable. Kelly Davies, from Emsworth, Hampshire, said the email asking for her personal information looked genuine. According to investigators Action Fraud, there has been a huge increase in phishing scams in the last week. The NHS said the vaccine was free of charge and it would never ask a patient for their bank account details. The email, which has been reported more than 1,000 times in 24 hours, asks the recipient to click on a link if they want to receive the vaccine. They are then asked to input their bank card details. Ms Davies, 42, said she was "sceptical" about the email as she knew people at higher risk than herself would be contacted first. Kelly Davies said she had been 'sceptical' of the email but feared vulnerable people would be taken advantage of She added: "It looked very much legitimate, with the NHS logos, and the government site logos, as you'd expect. "It's quite worrying and there'll be people sat at home that are waiting and who need that vaccination. "For people to prey on those individuals is awful. It's a horrible thing and people just shouldn't be doing that." Recipients are asked to input personal information when they accept the invitation Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud, said: "It's despicable that fraudsters will take advantage of such an important tool in the fight against this evil and deadly disease. "Not only are the people being targeted with this email at risk of losing money, or having their identity stolen, but they are also at risk of not receiving the real vaccine." She said the public needed to "remain cautious and alert". The NHS will not... Source: NHS Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS medical director for primary care, said the excitement around the vaccine had brought out the "cheats, crooks and con-people looking to make money from this life-saving programme". "The vaccine will always be free on the NHS," she added. An NHS spokeswoman said patients were normally contacted by post, via the national booking system, regarding vaccine appointments. They may also be contacted by the local GP practice by telephone or text message, she added. Det Sgt Marcus Mills, based at the economic crime unit at Hampshire Constabulary, said: "Sadly, despite being in a worldwide pandemic, criminals continue to seek and exploit vulnerable people with phishing email scams." He said residents should not click on any links within an email "unless it is from a trusted source - regardless of how genuine the email may look". "Fraudsters are able to use sophisticated techniques and email address masking to make the email appear genuine," he explained.

Flagship Group, based in Norwich, said the cyber attack on 1 November took "most of our group's systems offline". It said the incident had been caused by a suspected phishing or ransomware attack. It said it had closed down its online systems while it was investigated, and had reported the breach to police and the Information Commissioner's Office. On its website it said: "Despite our quick action, there has been some data encryption and some personal customer and staff data has been compromised. "We do not yet have a complete picture of all the data that has been encrypted." The company also said it had "a high level of security measures" in place to protect data. Flagship Group owns some 31,000 homes in the East of England and employs 1,200 people in its facilities, repairs, maintenance and heating departments. In 2017-18, it had an annual turnover of £133.7m It has tenants in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge and Essex and also builds and sells houses to private owners. 'Considerable disruption' Chief executive David McQuade apologised to tenants affected by the breach and those experiencing delays in having repairs carried out. "We are now working towards the recovery of all our systems," he said. "The incident has caused considerable disruption to our staff and customer services and we are concentrating on emergency situations, to ensure our customers are safe." The firm said the matter had also been reported to the Regulator of Social Housing. Norfolk Police said it was being dealt with by the National Cyber Security Centre . The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) confirmed it had been informed. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .

Tayside residents have been targeted by callers pretending to be from their banks or other business companies. Victims are encouraged to either transfer money to another account or provide personal banking details. A 75-year-old Montrose man was also persuaded to transfer £74,000 into other accounts. Police said his bank managed to retrieve the money. The Dundee pensioner was called by criminals who claimed to be from her bank's fraud department. Police said the bank is currently attempting retrieve the six-figure sum. In a third case, a pensioner from Kinross lost £5,000 after being called by a person claiming to work for BT, who said her computer had been hacked and persuaded her to hand over her bank details. A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police would advise residents to be alert to any phone call they receive from a person claiming to be from a bank, financial institution, business company either asking for money to be transferred or asking for a phone call to be made to the bank. "Do not provide any of your details. "If you do decide to call the bank, where possible call from a different phone line or mobile number. "If in doubt, ask the caller to put a stop on your account and attend your branch in person."People's Energy data breach affects all 270,000 customers By Zoe Kleinman 17 December 2020 The company People's Energy has contacted all its 270,000 current customers, following a data breach. Co-founder Karin Sode told BBC News an entire database had been stolen by hackers and included information on previous customers. Data stolen included names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, tariff and energy meter IDs, she said. But with the exception of that of 15 small-business customers, no financial information had been accessed. Those businesses' bank accounts and sort codes had been accessed, Ms Sode said. And they had been contacted separately by phone. Phishing attacks Most of those affected are unlikely to face any direct financial risk. But having their data stolen may leave them more vulnerable to phishing attacks - where a criminal pretends to be from an official source to try to obtain other information, often using what they already have to sound credible. The breach was discovered on Wednesday morning. And People's Energy has contacted the Information Commissioner's Office, the National Centre for Cyber-Security, the energy regulator Ofgem and the police. 'Big blow' Based in Edinburgh, the company also has customers in England and Wales. Ms Sode said it was investigating the breach and had called in independent experts but so far had no information about the identity of the hackers. David Pike and Karin Sode co-founded People's Energy in 2017 She and David Pike founded People's Energy, in August 2017, with a commitment to sustainable energy and returning 75% of all profits to customers. "This is a big blow in every way," Ms Sode said on Thursday. "We want people to feel they can trust us. "This was not part of the plan." "We're upset and sorry." A helpline has been set up for customers .Canadian university loses $10m in phishing scam 31 August 2017 A Canadian university says staffers unwittingly lost $9.5m (C$11.8m; £7.5m) in an online phishing scam. Fraudulent emails convinced staff at MacEwan University that one of its clients was changing its bank account details. Staff then paid money into the fraudulently created account. The university, in Edmonton, Alberta, is auditing its business practices. Police have traced most of the funds to accounts in Hong Kong and Montreal, but no charges have been laid. The scam came to light when the real client complained of non-payment. "There is never a good time for something like this to happen," university spokesperson David Beharry said in a statement. "As our students come back to start the new academic year, we want to assure them and the community that our IT systems were not compromised during this incident." Phishing is a common type of internet fraud where scammers send emails that appear to be from a reputable company, enticing people to give up personal information. Mr Beharry also said the university was working to ensure that this fraud would not impact future educational or business operations. An internal review is expected to make recommendations on ways the school can prevent this from happening again. A preliminary audit found that protocols around changing banking information were "inadequate" and staff missed a number of opportunities to identify the fraud.Phishing helps hackers hijack accounts, says Google study 10 November 2017 Many people still use passwords that are very easy to guess Cyber-thieves grab almost 250,000 valid log-in names and passwords for Google accounts every week, suggests research. The study by Google and UC Berkeley looked at the ways email and other accounts get hijacked. It used 12 months of log-in and account data found on websites and criminal forums or which had been harvested by hacking tools. Google said the research helped secure accounts by showing how people fell victim to scammers and hackers. During the 12 months studying the underground markets, the researchers identified more than 788,000 credentials stolen via keyloggers, 12 million grabbed via phishing and 1.9 billion from breaches at other companies. Phishing involves attempts to trick people into handing over personal information and keyloggers are programs that record every key someone presses when using a computer. Physical location The most useful information for cyber-thieves came from keyloggers and phishing attacks as these included valid passwords in 12%-25% of attacks, it found. Phishing attacks posed the biggest risk to users as these helped malicious hackers scoop up about 234,000 valid names and passwords every week. By contrast, keyloggers only yielded about 15,000 valid credentials each week. Cyber-attackers also sought to grab other information that could be useful in attacks, said the researchers. Data about a person's internet address (IP) as well as the device they were using and their physical location were all potentially useful for attackers seeking to defeat security checks. Popular passwords found in data breaches Gathering this data was much harder, found the research, with only 3.8% of people who had credentials leaked also giving away IP addresses and fewer than 0.001% surrendering detailed device information. In a blog, Google said it would use the results of the research to refine the ways it spotted and blocked attempts to take over accounts. In particular it would enhance efforts to use historical data about where users logged in and the devices they used to thwart impersonation attacks. The company has a range of resources for people affected or looking to protect themselves. However, the researchers acknowledged that the "multi-pronged problem" of account hijacking required efforts in lots of different areas. It noted that only 3.1% of people who had an account hijacked subsequently started using improved security measures, such as two-factor authentication, after they regained control of a lost account. Because of this, they said, educating users about better ways to protect accounts should become a "major initiative".Election candidates warned about phishing attempts By Chris Vallance 17 May 2017 Advice has been sent to general election candidates - including recent MPs Candidates in the general election have been asked to look through their emails for signs that they have been targeted by a phishing attack. The list of potential targets includes recent MPs. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is part of GCHQ, disclosed the request in a document released early on 16 May. The BBC understands that the number of victims is currently understood to be in single figures. Candidates have been asked to look for suspicious emails received after Jan 2017. The NCSC declined to say if any data had been taken. A report in the Financial Times said it was "likely" that the phishing campaign had been orchestrated by a state. In a document titled Phishing: guidance for political parties and their staff, the centre says it has "become aware of phishing attacks to gain access to the online accounts of individuals that were MPs before dissolution of Parliament" and "other staff who work in political parties". Technology explained: What is phishing? The NCSC said the attacks were likely to continue "and may be sent to parliamentary email addresses, prospective parliamentary candidates, and party staff". 'Personal emails targeted' The BBC understands that so far victims' personal emails have been affected but no successful phishing attempts have been made via parliamentary email addresses. It is believed that the NCSC has contacted the Electoral Commission about the threat and that the commission will help to alert candidates. The centre said that potential victims should look out for "unexpected requests to reset your password for online or social media accounts (such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook or Twitter)". "Or you might have been asked to approve changes to your account that you've not requested." The NCSC did not say whether it knew who was behind the phishing campaign. Concern about phishing attempts has been on the rise lately Analysis by Gordon Corera, security correspondent, BBC News The warnings to political parties come as cyber-security officials brace themselves for some kind of incident during the elections. No-one can be sure that anything will take place, but the experience of the US and more recently France has led them to believe that some kind of theft and then dump of information is possible. In both those cases, a Russian hand is suspected. Intelligence agencies have historically kept their distance from the communication of politicians due to the doctrine that says MPs should not be monitored. But parties and politicians themselves have been asking for advice and guidance in recent months amid growing concerns. Concern about elections being targeted by hackers has been running high, following the attack on the Democratic National Committee during the US presidential election. US authorities attributed that incident to Russia and said that a significant component of the attack involved phishing. More recently, the electoral campaign of President Emmanuel Macron in France was targeted by a similar campaign. The NCSC has said the UK has "systems in place to defend against electoral fraud at all levels and [we] have seen no successful cyber-intervention in UK democratic processes". The BBC understands that since last month, the NCSC has delivered cyber-security seminars to the UK's political parties, with the aim of helping them reduce the risk of succumbing to an attack. Advice has also been offered to local authorities and the electoral commission.More than 746,000 NHS phishing emails blocked in a month By Mary-Ann Russon 6 February 2018 The National Cyber Security Centre blocked more than 746,000 NHS phishing emails in one month in 2017 More than 746,000 phishing emails pretending to be from the NHS were blocked in just one month in 2017, the National Cyber Security Centre says. A report on the first year of the GCHQ unit's cyber-defence programme found that it removed 121,479 phishing sites hosted in the UK. This reduced the UK's share of global phishing attacks from 5.3% to 3.1%. Three-quarters of UK government-related phishing sites were taken down in 24 hours. Phishing emails trick users into visiting websites that impersonate known brands and ask the user to log in to their account. This enables attackers to gather confidential login details or financial information . Phishing emails are also used to trick people into opening malicious email attachments that install malware on their computers. The methods of reducing phishing involved using various security scanning systems to perform millions of tests on government websites and emails being sent in and out of government networks. 'Simple things' "What they've done is not rocket science - the technology's been around for a while, but they've managed to persuade various government departments to do the simple things to reduce cyber-security threats dramatically," cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, told the BBC. "Phishing emails from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) used to be the most common emails you'd see, but they got the HMRC to put the technology in place, and the spoofing emails dropped to zero in a matter of days." Cyber-security expert Graham Cluley said that technologies used were not new, but the NCSC's efforts had produced "impressive results". "Of course they won't have caught every phishing attempt, but they will have helped stamp out many of the most convincing attacks," he told the BBC. Martyn Thomas, Gresham College's professor of IT, agreed: "I think their success rate on stopping really legitimate-looking spam is really high and they are to be congratulated." While Prof Thomas felt that the NCSC would benefit from having a "longer-term vision" when it came to cybersecurity, he felt the fact that the government agency could gain intelligence from GCHQ on potential cyber-attacks gave it an edge over commercial cybersecurity contractors. NHS targeted Prof Woodward said the NCSC's work was "an important development" because the organisation was able to close down the opportunity for people to pretend to be from within the NHS, which would help to prevent future attacks. "The biggest problem is people pretending to be within," he said. "Whenever you receive something that seems to come from your own network, you inherently trust it."Spear-phishing scammer demanded sex show By Zoe Kleinman 22 March 2017 It took minutes for the scammer to take over Six weeks ago, a young woman called Zed (not her real name) was in a meeting at work when a message popped up on Facebook Messenger from a distant friend. "Hey babe," it began. The friend asked Zed to vote for her in an online modelling competition, which she agreed to do. But then - disaster. Adding her email address to the competition register had caused a tech meltdown, her friend said. She needed to borrow her email log-in to fix it quickly and restore her votes. Zed was unsure. The friend begged - her career was at stake, she pleaded. Still in the meeting and powerless to make a call, Zed gave in - a momentary leap of faith. Except it was not her friend that she was talking to - someone else had got into the account and was pretending to be her. It's a scamming technique known as spear phishing. What is spear phishing? "Phishing uses behavioural psychology to trick victims into trusting the attacker in order to obtain sensitive information," said Paul Bischoff of Comparitech , who also talked to Zed. "Spear phishing is less prevalent, but far more dangerous. Spear phishing targets an individual or small group of people. The attacker can gather personal information about their target to build a more believable persona." How do I protect myself? Besides never sharing the credentials for your online accounts, a good way to stay safe is to enable "two-step authentication". This means that users must enter another code besides their password, received for example by their mobile phone, to log in. This can usually be set up in the security settings for your account or during the sign-up process. Two-step authentication is offered by Gmail, Hotmail, Apple, Amazon, Yahoo, Facebook and Twitter among others . Within minutes, Zed watched in horror as she was locked out of one account after another, as well as her Apple iCloud where she stored all her data - including a photo of her passport, bank details, and some explicit pictures. The hacker took control of all her IDs as they were all linked to the email address details she had supplied. The scammer also activated an extra layer of security, called two-step authentication, meaning that they received all alerts about her accounts and could reset them. Then a man called. The number had a Pakistan area code. "He started the call by saying he didn't want any drama, he didn't want me to cry, he wanted me to talk to him like a professional," she said. He sounded young, perhaps a college student, she thought. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning 'Immoral' He accused her of leading an "immoral" life. He had seen her photographs, he knew she had smoked and had boyfriends and was sexually active. He asked her what her parents would think and was furious when she said they already knew. "He claimed he had hacked thousands of women," Zed says. "He said 10 or 12 he had felt bad about because he couldn't find anything about them that was 'wrong'." Zed was not part of that group. "He said he was happy when he hacked my account. That I deserved everything." He told her he would post the explicit pictures on her Facebook page - where she has more than 1,000 friends. The scammer said he had targeted thousands of people. "I offered him money. I asked if I could pay. He said, 'Don't talk about money.' He sounded irritated," she said. Instead, he wanted her to perform a sex act for him on camera. Zed refused. "Either you do it for me or you do it for the whole world," he told her - and uploaded one of the photos to Facebook. Zed had already warned her boyfriend and parents who assembled an army of friends waiting to report activity on her account. Within 15 minutes it had been disabled by Facebook - but she still received concerned messages from contacts. "A friend who is like a brother sent me a message - it wasn't him who had seen [the photo] but a friend of his," she said. "I feel like I mustn't think too much about how many people saw [the photos]." The last thing the scammer said to her was, "Have a great life." "It seemed to me the only reason he was doing this was to morally police women and get them to do stuff for him," Zed said. The man didn't want money "He wanted a gallery of explicit photographs of women. That seemed to be his motive." Zed does not consider herself to be digitally naive. She is a bright, articulate 20-something from India who works in the media industry on the US east coast. "I have been tech savvy and on the internet almost my entire life - but I've never really seen the power of what people can do until now," she says. Regaining control of her accounts has been a struggle. It took Zed a month to get her Apple ID back after engineers created a bespoke questionnaire for her containing answers that were not stored in her account. Gmail and Facebook have also been restored, but she has lost Snapchat and her Hotmail address - her central account which she had used for more than 13 years. 'Chink in the armour' "I feel for the poor woman - these scams are so easy to fall for," said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. "I think what it shows is that security is a combination of people, process and technology.  You can be very 'savvy' in any one or two of these but scammers are superb at finding novel combinations that, frankly, we just wouldn't think of. "I know it sounds so obvious but, regardless of who they are, you should not share your username and password.  Give these scammers a small chink in the armour and they are sadly brilliant at getting in and running amok in your digital life." Zed still uses iCloud but does not store personal stuff on it anymore - and has activated two-step verification everywhere. "I still see the value in the storage. But I will never ever give any information away again," she said. Zed originally decided to share her story on community site Reddit after trying to find others who may have been conned by the same man. "I was really shocked to discover that I found absolutely nothing," she said. "I was hoping that speaking up about it would remedy that problem and encourage others to share their stories. "It also felt like the only way to get back at him." As far as Zed knows, the scammer has not been caught. "Cyber-criminals come in all shapes and sizes,' said prof Woodward. "Their motive is not always monetary gain. As we have sadly seen of late, revenge or just being plain malicious is a growing trend."Brazen fraudsters offer crime subscription service By Kevin Peachey 23 December 2020 Criminal organisations are offering subscription services to other fraudsters to teach them a scam in which they impersonate their victims. Fraud prevention organisation Cifas said fraudsters were sharing tips and getting more sophisticated in their attempts to steal money. Cases of a particular scam targeting shoppers, which often spikes at Christmas, have tripled this year. Criminals harvest personal information then buy items in someone else's name. Dark tips The so-called facility takeover fraud sees victims reveal personal or financial information to someone they believe is genuine, such as supposed bank staff. Criminals then use this information to access bank or credit card accounts to order items in the victim's name. Online banking accounts can also be taken over as a result of phishing, spyware or malware scams on computers. Cifas - a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies - said its intelligence team had seen evidence of criminals charging each other for information on the dark web. This is the part of the internet that is invisible to search engines. Criminals have long shared so-called sucker lists, detailing people who they have previously tricked in a scam and could be potential victims again. Details can be stolen in a variety of ways There were 7,461 reports in the retail sector from January to September recorded by Cifas, compared with 2,365 in the same period in 2019. There was also a big rise in cases of fraudsters using the same kind of scam to order mobile phones. Cifas said techniques used by criminals were becoming more sophisticated as they were finding new ways to circumvent security measures put in place by companies. Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: "We often notice a spike in this activity over the festive period, and so I would urge everyone to remain vigilant if contacted by anyone claiming to be from an organisation they trust, such as a bank, mobile phone company or even the police." Last month, banking trade body UK Finance warned criminals were using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails. These messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses. How to prevent fraud The Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign is urging people to:Google Docs phishing email 'cost Minnesota $90,000' 8 May 2017 The phishing email was sent to one million Gmail users last week A phishing email that targeted Gmail users is estimated to have cost the state of Minnesota $90,000 (£69,400). About 2,500 state employees received the email, according to the state chief information security officer. Around the world, people have reported getting multiple copies of the email, while others have received the message from trusted organisations. One million Gmail users, which Google says is "fewer than 0.1%", were affected. The cost to the Minnesota state government was mainly the result of employees dealing with the attack rather than carrying out their normal jobs, said state chief information security officer Christopher Buse. "I estimated three minutes of time per employee… it may be much more than that in many cases," he told ABC News . "It's important for people to understand not only that the attacks are happening but also to understand how costly they are." Mr Buse said that the cost could have been much higher but Minnesota state government agencies generally did not use Gmail or Google Docs. "Most of these scams are done using Office documents like Word and Excel spreadsheets", Ken Munro, of Pen Test Partners, told the BBC. "But a lot of big companies have moved away from traditional office software packages, and an increasing number are moving towards using Google." Other users affected Besides the Minnesota state government, a large number of other Gmail users were affected. Jacquelyn Piette, who is studying for an MBA at Boston College, tweeted that she had just received warning of the phishing scam when the message arrived in her inbox. Users who received the email were told a contact of theirs had shared a document with them on Google Docs. If they clicked on the "Open in Docs" button, they were taken to a genuine Google page that required them to log in with their account credentials. Once logged in, a service called "Google Apps" would ask them for permission to access their email account data. By agreeing to share their data, users were potentially giving the hackers access to their email account, contacts and online documents. The malware used this access to send copies of the phishing email to everyone in the recipient's contacts list. "As companies get better at security, scammers will start looking for connections between personal email accounts and professional accounts, which might sidestep some of the company's security," Mr Munro said. He said that introducing "layers of separation" - such as not checking personal email on the office computer - could help prevent such phishing campaigns spreading. "Companies could say they might not want you to check personal email on your work computer, but they don't mind you checking it on your mobile." Google said it had stopped the attack "within approximately one hour" and fewer than 0.1% of its users had been affected - about one million people. Those who did click on the link have been advised to log into their accounts and revoke access to Google Apps, then change their password.Google Docs users hit by phishing scam 4 May 2017 Google says it has stopped a phishing email that reached about a million of its users. The scam claimed to come from Google Docs - a service that allows people to share and edit documents online. Users who clicked a link and followed instructions, risked giving the hackers access to their email accounts. Google said it had stopped the attack "within approximately one hour", including through "removing fake pages and applications". "While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed," Google said in an updated statement. "There's no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup." During the attack, users were sent a deceptive invitation to edit a Google Doc, with a subject line stating a contact "has shared a document on Google Docs with you". The email address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator[.]com was also copied in to the message; Mailinator, a free email service provider has denied any involvement. If users clicked on the "Open in Docs" button in the email, they were then taken to a real Google-hosted page and asked to allow a seemingly real service , called "Google Docs", to access their email account data. Victims of the scam were asked to let a seemingly real service called "Google Docs" access their account data. By granting permission, users unwittingly allowed hackers to potentially access to their email account, contacts and online documents. The malware then e-mailed everyone in the victim's contacts list in order to spread itself. "This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party," Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU, told Reuters. 'Too widespread' According to PC World magazine, the scam was more sophisticated than typical phishing attacks, whereby people trick people into handing over their personal information by posing as a reputable company. This is because the hackers bypassed the need to steal people's login credentials and instead built a third-party app that used Google processes to gain account access. The Russian hacking group Fancy Bear has been accused of using similar attack methods, but one security expert doubted their involvement. "I don't believe they are behind this... because this is way too widespread," Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at security provider AlienVault, told PC World. Google said the spam campaign affected "fewer than 0.1%" of Gmail users. That works out to about one million people affected. Last year, an American man pleaded guilty to stealing celebrities' nude pictures by using a phishing scam to hack their iCloud and Gmail accounts. And in 2013, Google said it had detected thousands of phishing attacks targeting email accounts of Iranian users ahead of the country's presidential election .Subway customers receive 'malware' emails 11 December 2020 Subway customers in the UK are receiving scam emails as part of a phishing attack. Users took to social media to complain about the emails, which claim to be an order confirmation from the fast-food chain and contain links to malware. The emails also use the victims' names, and appear to come from the chain's Subcard loyalty scheme. Subway has not said whether its databases have been compromised or what the source of the scam is. But the firm has acknowledged that there is a problem. A spokesperson for the company said: "We are aware of some disruption to our email systems and understand some of our guests have received an unauthorised email." It apologised for any inconvenience and advised people to delete the email. Sandwich insurance The problem was earlier reported by computer security news site Bleeping Computer , which said it had found a form of malware called TrickBot in the malicious links the email encourages users to click. Trickbot is designed to steal personal information from infected computers, and can also install other viruses and ransomware. The email links to fake documents that supposedly need to be confirmed - including insurance documents for the sandwich, suggesting that the attack had been repurposed from an existing scam. Bleeping Computer reports that these documents include an Excel spreadsheet download, which asks users to enable additional features that install the virus. It is not clear how the attacker accessed the details of customers. Online, some recipients claimed that the attack email appeared to come from the address that the company usually uses. Update 12 December: Subway has issued a fresh statement: "Having investigated the matter, we have no evidence that guest accounts have been hacked. However, the system which manages our email campaigns has been compromised, leading to a phishing campaign that involved first name and email. The system does not hold any bank or credit card details. Crisis protocol was initiated and compromised systems locked down. The safety of our guests and their personal data is our overriding priority and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused."Coronavirus: Hackers targeted Covid vaccine supply 'cold chain' Gordon Corera @gordoncorera 3 December 2020 The international vaccine supply chain has been targeted by cyber-espionage, according to IBM. The company says it tracked a campaign aimed at the delivery "cold chain" used to keep vaccines at the right temperature during transportation. The attackers' identity is unclear - but IBM said the sophistication of their methods indicated a nation state. It follows warnings from governments - including the UK's - of countries targeting aspects of vaccine research. Phishing emails IBM says it believes the campaign started in September 2020. It says phishing emails were sent out across six countries, which targeted organisations linked to the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP) of Gavi, the international vaccine alliance. Gavi's partners include the World Health Organization, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They help distribute vaccines around the world to some of the poorest regions. This sometimes requires a "cold chain". Malicious code For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which was not the specific target of this campaign - will need to be kept at a temperature of about -70C as it is moved about. The attackers impersonated a business executive from a legitimate Chinese company involved in CCEOP's supply cold chain to make it more likely the targets would engage with the email. They then sent phishing emails to organisations that provided transportation, which contained malicious code and asked for people's log in credentials. That could have allowed them to understand the infrastructure that governments intended to use to distribute vaccines. "Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target," IBM says. 'Precision targeting' IBM says the wider targeting included: Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. IBM says the campaign was uncovered by a security team it set up at the start of the pandemic to track down Covid-19 cyber-threats. "The precision targeting and nature of the specific targeted organisations potentially point to nation-state activity," the US company said. "Without a clear path to a [pay]out, cyber-criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation." Intelligence gathering IBM says it has notified those targeted as well as law-enforcement authorities. The US's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) has issued an alert encouraging organisations associated with the storage and transport of a vaccine to be on guard for the kind of attacks linked to IBM's report . In July, the UK warned Russian intelligence had targeted UK vaccine research, including at Oxford. The US also warned of Chinese hacking, while, more recently, Microsoft said it had seen North Korean and Russian hackers targeting vaccine research. Officials suggested the activity so far had been about intelligence gathering rather than disruption of any research.Technology explained: What is phishing? Phishing remains one of the most common ways that cybercriminals get hold of your personal details. The BBC's Chris Fox explains what it is and how you can protect yourself. 4 August 2016 BBC News TechnologyDocuSign users sent phishing emails after data breach 17 May 2017 Electronic signature service provider DocuSign has admitted customer email addresses were accessed in a data breach. The addresses were then targeted in a series of phishing emails from "a malicious third party". The messages invited recipients to click on a link to a Microsoft Word document containing malware. DocuSign said that no other information was accessed in the incident, and the e-signature service remained secure. "No names, physical addresses, passwords, social security numbers, credit card data or other information was accessed," the company said in a statement. "DocuSign's core e-signature service, envelopes and customer documents and data remain secure." The company has advised people to delete any suspicious messages immediately. 'Temporary access' The breach came to light when the company noticed an increase in phishing emails sent to some of their account holders last week. According to a statement published on DocuSign's website, "a malicious third party gained temporary access to a separate, non-core system that allows us to communicate service-related announcements to users via email". The emails included the DocuSign branding and appeared to come from addresses ending "docus.com", a lookalike domain. The subject line referred to either a wire transfer or an accounting invoice, saying: "Document Ready for Signature". DocuSign users received emails asking them to review and sign a document A full copy of the email has been published on the TechHelpList website, which reported that the malware contained in the attachment could be used to steal passwords and banking credentials. "Phishing is almost the default way of tricking people into giving away that information," Keith Martin, professor of information security at Royal Holloway, University of London, told the BBC. "Where it's targeting a bank, for example, the senders are going to use headers and language that'll make customers believe it's their bank. "With a generic phishing trawl, the message will go out and the more people who click the better - it's literally like fishing, hoping to get some bites, chucking a message out there speculatively. "With most, you don't need a very high success rate to make money."Students warned of new 'phishing' scam 20 September 2016 Students are warned to be aware of an email offering them an educational grant and asking them for their bank details New students are being alerted to a scam where fraudsters claim to offer a "educational grant" in a bid to con them into divulging bank details. The personal finance site Money Saving Expert says it is aware of students at major universities being targeted in a new wave of " phishing emails". At Queen Mary University London, one student was tricked out of £300. University of Glasgow said it was also aware of the scam and had advised students to ignore the email. Fake grants The mother of the QMUL student said her daughter had received the scam email last week. It looked as if it had come from the university's finance department, complete with the logo, and invited the young woman to claim a government bursary. An online form asked her for personal and banking details and took her to a bank verification page, which was when she became suspicious. But, MSE says, the student found the fraudsters had already taken £300 from her bank account. In a statement QMUL said: "We were made aware late last week that a number of QMUL students had received these phishing emails. "QMUL proactively monitors its systems to prevent and detect breaches, and there is no evidence to suggest any system has been compromised in this instance. "A message was sent to all students warning them about the scam and providing them with advice on how they can protect themselves online, including details of our cybersecurity training courses." The university said it did not believe the scam had affected many students and said it was confident its own systems had not been breached. The University of Glasgow said it would never ask for banking information in this way. In an email to all students, the university said it had become aware of a scam email headed: "Educational Grant Information". "This is an email message that appears as if it has come from the University of Glasgow's finance department. It has not," the university said. Earlier this year, the police site Action Fraud warned of a similar "phishing" campaign at universities. One student lost £300 after falling for the scam The Student Loans Company said students were particularly vulnerable to "phishing" attempts around the main payment dates, in September, January and April. "Phishing emails are sent in batches so there will be more in circulation," it said. "We want to remind students to stay vigilant with the details they provide online," said Paul Mason, the SLC director responsible for combating fraud. He advised students receiving unsolicited emails to be alert to poor spelling and grammar and to demands for a rapid response. They are also advised not to reply and not to click on any links. Suspected attempts should be reported to phishing@slc.co.uk or to Action Fraud.Email 'most popular phishing tool' 26 April 2016 Phishing mails get opened about 30% of the time, suggests the report Cyber-thieves are sticking to email as their preferred way to trick victims into falling for scams, suggests a report. The online crime groups were shunning mobiles and newer technologies in favour of phishing campaigns, said the report from Verizon. The annual analysis catalogues more than 100,000 security incidents that hit thousands of companies in 2015. Almost 90% of the incidents involved attempts to steal cash, it said. The gangs were sticking to booby-trapped emails because they were proving increasingly effective, said Marc Spitler, lead author on the report. And, so far, there was little evidence novel technologies involving net-connected gadgets or smartphones were becoming a popular attack route. About 30% of phishing emails had been opened by people in targeted organisations in 2015, said the report, up from 23% in 2014. And, of the scam emails opened, about 13% had been able to launch malware because staff had run the attachments they had carried. This meant, said Mr Spitler, it often took just minutes for criminals to compromise the network of a targeted company. "If an attack works, then it works very quickly," he said. "The phishing email typically leads to the installation of malware or the compromise of a user's PC by some sort of malicious code that can establish control or persistence on a network," said Mr Spitler. Unfortunately, he added, although companies fell victim quickly, they could take far longer to notice they had been breached. Statistics gathered for the Verizon report suggest 84% of the organisations questioned took weeks to spot that criminals had won access to internal systems.Phishing email that knows your address 6 April 2016 The email demands payment of £800 to a firm You and Yours report Shari Vahl had never heard of A new type of phishing email that includes the recipient's home address has been received by thousands of people, the BBC has learned. Members of the BBC Radio 4's You and Yours team were among those who received the scam emails, claiming they owed hundreds of pounds to UK firms. The firms involved have been inundated with phone calls from worried members of the public. One security expert warned clicking on the link would install malware. You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl was one of the first on the team to receive an email. "The email has good spelling and grammar and my exact home address...when I say exact I mean, not the way my address is written by those autofill sections on web pages, but the way I write my address. "My tummy did a bit of a somersault when I read that, because I wondered who on earth I could owe £800 to and what was about to land on my doormat." She quickly realised it was a scam and did not click on the link. "Then, a couple of minutes later, You and Yours producer Jon Douglas piped up as he'd received one and then another colleague said he'd received one too, but to his home email address," she added. Ransomware The You and Yours team decided to contact the companies that were listed in the emails as being owed money. A spokesman for British Millerain Co Ltd, a waxed cotton fabric manufacturer, told the programme that the firm "had more than 150 calls from people who don't owe us money". And a spokeswoman for Manchester shelving firm Greenoaks said: "My colleague took a call from an elderly gentleman and he was very distressed because his wife had had one of these emails." Dr Steven Murdoch, principal research fellow at the department of computer science at University College London, told You and Yours: "Most likely it was a retailer or other internet site that had been hacked into and the database stolen, it then could have been sold or passed through several different people and then eventually it got to the person who sent out these emails." He said that the email bore the hallmark of previous phishing attempts from gangs in Eastern Europe and Russia. He said that clicking on the link would install malware such as Cryptolocker, which is a form of ransomware that will encrypt files on Windows-based computers and then demand a fee to unlock them. Technology explained: what is ransomware? Anyone receiving such an email is advised to delete it and report it to the national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre Action Fraud .Football fans sent £170 bill in phishing email from SFA 5 December 2016 The phishing email was sent to subscribers to the Scotland national team mailing list Thousands of football fans were sent a scam email asking them to pay a bill after a Scottish Football Association database was apparently hacked. An invoice for £170 was sent to subscribers to the Scotland Supporters Club mailing list just after 09:00. The email - addressed "Dear Customer" - provided a link for payment, which was a disguised website address. The SFA said a third-party email database had been compromised and urged recipients to delete the email. Its statement said: "We would like to apologise to those who have received a spoof email this morning purporting to be from the Scottish FA." It recommended that anyone who may have opened it run a security check on their computer to ensure no malware had been installed. Virus fears It said: "We would like to assure all supporters that no bank or credit card details have been shared. "We have moved to delete this account and the issue has been raised with our suppliers. "We will provide an update in early course." Fans on message boards suggested that clicking on the link within the scam email could infect computers with a virus and leave them out of pocket. The email contained links identical to those sent on official communications to supporters and were signed off as being from the "Accounts Department" of the Scotland Supporters Club. The group - which gives members access to away tickets for Scotland matches - currently has 29,231 members.Cyber attack: No customer or staff data stolen, Flagship Group says 24 November 2020 Flagship Group experienced an IT systems data breach on 1 November An initial internal investigation into a cyber attack on a housing firm found no evidence customer or staff data was stolen. Flagship Group, based in Norwich, said the attack took "most of our group's systems offline". It said a suspected phishing or ransomware attack on 1 November caused "considerable disruption" to staff and customer services. The firm said other independent investigations were ongoing. The attack was reported to the Regulator of Social Housing , the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The NCSC and the ICO have not yet reported the findings of their investigations. In a statement, Flagship said its IT systems were now "in a stage of carefully controlled recovery". The firm said it had also offered fraud and web monitoring services to its customers and staff "for added piece of mind". Flagship Group owns some 31,000 homes in the East of England and employs 1,200 people in its facilities, repairs, maintenance and heating departments. In 2017-18, it had an annual turnover of £133.7m. It has tenants in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge and Essex and also builds and sells houses to private owners.

Compiled by Verizon, the report looks at analyses of almost 80,000 security incidents that hit thousands of companies in 2014. It found that, in many companies, about 25% of those who received a phishing email were likely to open it. "Training your employees is a critical element of combating this threat," said Bob Rudis, lead author on the report. Threat spotting Tricking people into opening a booby-trapped message let attackers grab login credentials that could be used to trespass on a network and steal data, the report said. "They do not have to use complex software exploits, because often they can get hold of legitimate credentials," Mr Rudis said. Analysis of data breaches found that, in many cases, it had taken less than two minutes for freshly sent phishing emails to catch their first victim. And, said Mr Rudis, half of the victims had clicked on the message within the first hour of it being sent. Although attackers racked up victims quickly, it took companies far longer to notice they had been compromised, Mr Rudis said. The report also found companies could take straight-forward steps to defend themselves against well-crafted phishing emails designed to make people open them and their attachments. Teaching staff to spot bogus messages could reduce the proportion of victims to sent emails from one in four to one in 20, he said. Showing workers the tell-tale signs of a phishing email could also turn them into another line of defence that could catch messages missed by automatic detection systems. "They should be treating employees as tools in the fight rather than as lambs to the slaughter," Mr Rudis said. After phishing, some cyber-thieves relied on companies running un-patched software that was vulnerable to old and well-known exploits, he said. More than 99% of the vulnerabilities exploited in data breaches had been known about for more than a year, Mr Rudis said. And some had been around for a decade. "There are some vulnerabilities that just linger out there," he said. A good patching regime would help companies protect themselves against most of the vulnerabilities cyber-thieves abuse, Mr Rudis added.

On Tech Tent we assess the damage done by what may be the most successful act of cyber-espionage yet seen. It was last Sunday when it emerged that a company called SolarWinds had been hacked and its customers were being advised to disconnect from one of its key products, the Orion Platform, used to monitor networks. I'm sure many people yawned and thought this was just another hack but to cyber-security experts the name of the company targeted was a red flag. "The moment I heard SolarWinds was involved, the alarm bells went off," Rick Holland, chief information security officer at Digital Shadows, tells Tech Tent. That was because customers of SolarWinds network monitoring tools include many branches of the US government. "You have the highest tiers of both the military side of the government, as well as the civilian agencies in the government, as well." Through the week it seemed each day brought news of another key agency whose defences had been breached since the attackers tampered with an update to the SolarWinds Orion platform. The Departments of Treasury and Commerce were named first, then Homeland Security, the National Institute of Health and even the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab were said to have been compromised. The FBI is among those investigating the hacking campaign At an early stage Reuters news agency said three sources had told it Russia was behind the attack - an allegation the Russian Foreign Ministry described as baseless. The US government has been cautious about attributing the attack to the Russians, although the FBI has said it is investigating "in order to attribute, pursue, and disrupt the responsible threat actors". In the New York Times on Thursday President Trump's former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, was clear about who he thinks is responsible. "The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate," he wrote. "The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months." But whoever did it, how did they manage to get through the defences of a company like SolarWinds with what the company describes as a " very sophisticated supply-chain attack"? Rick Holland has a theory: "We do know that SolarWinds, in their filing to the Security and Exchange Commission this week, alluded to Microsoft, which makes me think that the initial access into the SolarWinds environment was through a phishing email. So someone clicked on something they thought was benign -  turned out it was not benign." If it did all start with a phishing email, that won't sound too sophisticated to many people. But in a blog post , calling for a global response to what he describes as a moment of reckoning, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, says his own company's investigations confirm that this was an attack "remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact". President Trump has yet to comment on the hack which security experts see as hugely significant While not attributing the attack to Russia in so many words, he notes the country's involvement in previous hacks and calls this latest one "an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world". Much of the language used about this attack by both American government officials and private companies sounds like that used during periods of tension during the Cold War. But so far, the man who leads the United States has been silent. President Trump was swift in sacking US cyber-security chief Chris Krebs after he described the November election as the most secure in American history. But he has not said a word about what looks like the modern equivalent of an armed raid on the United States mainland by a foreign power.'Phishing' scam cost London woman nearly £50,000 A woman has told the Victoria Derbyshire programme how she was conned out of her life savings by scammers who sent her a 'phishing' email. 59-year-old Vivian Gabb, a pilates and tennis coach from London, was in the final stages of buying a house when the scammers struck. She was unaware that her email had been hacked and every email she wrote and received was being monitored by criminals. They sent her a message disguised as a follow-up email from her solicitor, asking for nearly £50,000 to be paid into their account. The internet safety advice website Get Safe Online says more than half (51%) of people in the UK have been a victim of an online crime, and 15% of people have been victims of either attempted or successful hacks of their email account.

Icann, which administers the net's addressing system, said spoofed emails were used to reach an internal network. The attackers used this access to steal lists of contact and login information for people who control some of the net's most popular domains. Icann said it had notified people that their data may have gone astray and asked them to change their passwords. Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, was set up to oversee the underlying addressing system that keeps the net running and ensures data gets where it is supposed to go. In a blogpost , Icann said some of its staff were tricked into opening booby-trapped email messages sent by attackers that were crafted to look like they came from other employees. The attack took place in late November and Icann realised it had been attacked about a week later. The booby-trapped emails helped the attackers capture login name and password details for Icann's internal network that attackers then used to snoop around the organisation's systems. An investigation by Icann revealed that the attackers got at a system called the Centralised Zone Data System (CZDS) that lists who looks after what is known as generic top-level domains. This includes the widely used .com, .info, .net and .org domains as well as a host of other more recently established domains. Icann said it was not possible to alter any details of who administers these domains from its CZDS system. Passwords were stored in a hard to crack format, said Icann, and added it had deactivated passwords so those with legitimate access to CZDS would have to generate a new one. "Based on our investigation to date, we are not aware of any other systems that have been compromised," it said, adding that it had now put in place more stringent security systems to prevent another breach.British Airways warning over phishing email 25 February 2014 British Airways said it had been contacted by a number of people who had received the fake email British Airways has issued a warning about a fake 'phishing' email purporting to come from the airline. On Monday, a County Down man received an email from BC.CustSrvcs@email.ba.com confirming an order for a flight from London on Feb 26 with a price of £490. The man had not booked any such flight. While no money was taken from him, he was asked to click on links to confirm the flight. BA has warned the email is an attempt to get people's personal details. The airline said it had been contacted by a number of customers on Monday who had received such an email. BA said other examples of fake emails included: The airline said the emails are not from British Airways, but are attempts to secure personal information or extort money from consumers. "Legitimate emails from British Airways will contain your booking reference and the email will not have been sent from a web-based mail server such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc," BA said. "In addition, British Airways will never request money payments through a third party or promise you any kind of cash prize." "If any customers have any doubts about emails they have received, British Airways advises that they should not click on any links or download any files. "If you or anyone else receives these emails, please forward suspected email scams to: phishing@email.ba.com and British Airways will investigate its authenticity and take appropriate action." A Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment spokeswoman said they were aware of the scam but had not received any complaints. "Legitimate businesses don't ask you to send sensitive information through insecure channels," she said. "Always look carefully at the email address the message has been sent from, as they will often closely resemble a genuine email address, with perhaps one or two letters spelled differently."Webscape: Protection from phishing attacks Kate Russell's weekly review of the best apps and websites.

Members of Match.com, eHarmony, Zoosk, Christian Mingle and many others had received emails seeking to steal login details for the sites, said Netcraft . The net monitoring firm said the emails had been sent from other websites, hacked to hide the senders' identity. Stolen data would be used to befriend other users in an attempt to trick them into handing over cash, it said. The phishing campaign against dating sites marked a departure for fraudsters, who typically preferred to target banks, said Paul Mutton, a security analyst at Netcraft who investigated the attacks. The attacks were "massive", he said, adding that in the past week Netcraft had seen more than 100 compromised sites targeting Match.com alone. So far, he said, it was not clear how sites were being compromised to host the scripts. Websites and servers run by individuals, small businesses, construction firms and telecom suppliers had all become unwitting hosts of the phishing tools, he added. Mr Mutton said just one compromised site he had seen was home to about 800 short programs or scripts that targeted many different dating sites. Each script looked like it had been generated by a "kit" bought online. "Anyone with a very basic knowledge of programming could make use of the kit," he said. Extract cash The scripts are used to craft phishing emails that are spammed out to potential victims. The mails seek to trick people into entering their login names for the dating sites. If successful, the details are passed on to the legitimate login page of a dating website and are also sent to one of 300 email addresses used by the phishing gang. Fraudsters were keen to steal login details for accounts so they could avoid paying the charges dating sites levied before users could swap messages with other members, said Mr Mutton. Using on-site messages the fraudsters hope to befriend others and then try to extract cash to help pay for a non-existent medical condition or to aid fictitious relatives. Significant amounts of cash could be stolen this way, said Mr Mutton, pointing to the case of Karen and Tracy Vasseur, of Colorado, who were jailed in 2013 for stealing more than $1m (£590,000) from 374 people using dating-site scams.Bitcoin investors: From buying a Bentley to losing it all By Zoe Kleinman 9 February Javed Khan's dad was impressed with his new wheels Bitcoin has soared to trade at an eye-watering $48,000 (£34,820), following the news that Tesla has bought $1.5bn of the crypto-currency. Enthusiasts will tell you it's the future of money - but investing in the notoriously volatile virtual currency can be a rollercoaster, and it's not without risk. The hunt for new coins, using powerful computers, is also causing a surge in energy demand - which is not so good for the environment. Here are some of your Bitcoin adventures. 'It paid for a holiday in Iceland' James Saye, tech consultant I first invested in Bitcoin in 2017 - I was nervous about putting too much in, so I went for around £500. I cashed it in for £2,500 during one of its peaks, and had a great holiday in Iceland - the cash came in handy, Iceland is lovely but expensive. I bought in again in 2018 when the price was lower so I'm still in but I don't regret cashing out when I did. 'It's part of my pension plan' Heather Delaney, founder of Gallium Ventures I've been the silent crypto-investor. I put in £5 at the very beginning and I've built it slowly and steadily over time. I see it as a long-term strategy, meaning the rapid highs and lows are not ones that cause me anxiety - although ask me as I near my retirement and we shall see what I think then! Based on how much I have invested in Bitcoin over time versus what I see today, I have a 585.41% increase in my investment. I've never cashed it out - but I have converted some to other currencies as the market has fluctuated. I know loads of people who have done exciting things with their investments but for me it's part of my pension plan. I know I'm not typical. 'He didn't get a single penny back' David Stubley, founder of 7 Elements cyber-security firm We had a client whose Bitcoin wallet was fraudulently accessed and all the money was transferred out of it. He had intended to use it as a deposit on a house. The man had been spooked by reports of fluctuations in the currency and decided to check his wallet. But he clicked on a fraudulent link, which led him to a phishing site, a complete clone of the real thing. He had 84 bitcoins, and the fraudsters transferred 83 of them. At the time, in 2017, they were worth $475,000. We tracked the payment on the blockchain [a kind of shared digital public ledger] - we could see it rolling across various wallets and finally it reached a wallet containing $15m of currency. While the final identity of the fraudsters could not be identified, we were able to have the wallets frozen, so at least denying access to the stolen funds. Our client was irate but philosophical. Today, that stolen Bitcoin would be worth £2.8m. Once it's gone, it really has gone. 'I bought a Bentley' Javed Khan, independent trader My Bitcoin journey didn't start as an investment. At first, it was a form of transferring money, I didn't have to wait for confirmation from banks and so on - it was convenient. In 2018, I noticed I'd make a transfer, leave some Bitcoin in my wallet and I'd see the prices go up - and before I knew it I was seeing profit, which surprised me. I had been telling my friends I was using it as a transfer tool, I hadn't thought about investing in it. In January 2020, I cashed in my Bitcoin profits and bought a Bentley in Dubai, where I now live. I sent a video from the showroom to my mum and she cried, she was really proud. I would only put in money that I could afford to lose. The most I've lost is the transaction fees - when the price drops I don't lose faith. I think the best time to buy Bitcoin is when nobody's talking about it - wait for the hype to die down. 'My electricity bill was A$600 a month when I was mining Bitcoin' Rohan Muscat, project manager and electrical engineer I became aware of Bitcoin in 2010, but being a bit of a hardware geek, I wanted to mine it. In late 2016 I bought a pair of graphics cards to mine, and at first I did pretty well with it. A start-up I'd done some consulting for gave me some Horizon State tokens (another form of crypto-currency) to pay part of my way, and in January 2017 those plus my mined assets were worth A$40,000 (£22,000). I decided to trade it a bit, and investigated bots while moving to bigger scale mining. At first it paid for itself, but then it went downhill and was borderline break-even. My electricity bill shot up to A$500-A$600 a month, because the mining rig needed so much power. I ended up selling the mining gear, and I'm currently sitting on about A$2,000 in crypto. I could have made more if I'd jumped in and out, but the emotions and risks in trading have burnt me, and I'd rather not take the risk. 'Bitcoin helped me buy my house' Daniel Crocker, business owner In 2012, I was doing an apprenticeship at an IT company. At lunchtime we used to chat about little ways of making money on the side. Nobody had really heard of Bitcoin but we decided to give it a go and we spent a few weeks on it. It didn't last long, but luckily I kept hold of mine. I traded them in last summer and got half the deposit for my house. I've still got a little bit but I'm just going to sit tight - it's not something I want to pin my future on. I do know people who have gone in deep but I think I've been lucky enough already.Peter Pan Bournemouth theatre phishing email hits thousands 9 September 2014 Recipients of the email were told they had bought tickets for Bournemouth Pavilion's Christmas show A phishing email purporting to have been sent from a theatre ticket agency could have affected thousands of computer users, the firm said. The email states that the recipient has booked tickets to Bournemouth Pavilion's Peter Pan show at Christmas, but includes a link which installs a virus. BH Live said there had been no data breach of its customers' details. Head of communications Matt Good called it "a classic phishing exercise". He said the agency started to receive calls about the emails, which look identical to its usual email postings, early on Monday morning. Mr Good said: "The emails were sent from known spam IP addresses." "A number of precautionary measures have been taken to ensure data, systems and networks continue to be protected," he added. Anyone receiving the mails is advised not to open them and not to click on the enclosed link. They have also been urged to update online and computer passwords.Google blocking 18m coronavirus scam emails every day By Joe Tidy 17 April 2020 Scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to Gmail users every day, according to Google. The tech giant says the pandemic has led to an explosion of phishing attacks in which criminals try to trick users into revealing personal data. The company said it was blocking more than 100 million phishing emails a day. Over the past week, almost a fifth were scam emails related to coronavirus. The virus may now be the biggest phishing topic ever, tech firms say. Google's Gmail is used by 1.5 billion people. One of the scam emails impersonates the World Health Organization Individuals are being sent a huge variety of emails which impersonate authorities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), in an effort to persuade victims to download software or donate to bogus causes. Cyber-criminals are also attempting to capitalise on government support packages by imitating public institutions. Google claims that its machine-learning tools are able to block more than 99.9% of emails from reaching its users. This scam email targeted businesses on Gmail The growth in coronavirus-themed phishing is being recorded by several cyber-security companies. Barracuda Networks said it had seen a 667% increase in malicious phishing emails during the pandemic. Scammers have been sending fake emails and text messages claiming to be from the UK government, the WHO, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and even individual US officials, including President Trump. "Phishing attacks always share the common trait of inciting or depending on an emotion that causes us to act more hastily or think less about our actions at that moment in time," said independent security researcher Scott Helme. "The coronavirus pandemic is a highly emotional topic right now and cyber-criminals clearly know this. They're hoping that the typical person might be more inclined to click through links or follow bad instructions if they use this lure." 'Exploitation' Researchers have also found malicious websites and smartphone applications based on genuine coronavirus resources. One malicious Android app claims to help track the spread of the virus, but instead infects the phone with ransomware and demands payment to restore the device. Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre and the US Department of Homeland Security issued a joint advisory. They said they had seen "an increasing number of malicious cyber-actors" that were "exploiting the current Covid-19 pandemic for their own objectives". The NCSC has published advice on its website to help people avoid becoming the victim of a scam.Covid: Police pressure as pandemic changes 'landscape of crime' By Rachel Flint 4 February Police have been breaking up house parties and stopping people visiting beauty spots while dealing with increases in violent crime Unprecedented changes in lifestyle in the coronavirus pandemic led to an acceleration in shifts in criminal behaviour in Wales, a crime expert has said. Levels of reported crime fell across Wales from October 2019-2020, including in the first few months of the pandemic. But figures show reports of cyber crime, stalking and harassment spiked. Professor Martin Innes said challenges were "unprecedented" in modern times. The Cardiff University professor said while it was hard to predict the future, an increase in digital crime during the pandemic, teamed with the economic impact and increases in social tension mixed for a "worrying cocktail" for post-lockdown crime. Police forces across Wales have repeatedly warned of being under immense pressure during the pandemic as they try to enforce Covid laws while dealing with serious and violent crime. Recent figures, released by the Office of National Statistics , show 245,591 crimes were reported to Welsh police forces between October 2019 and September 2020, a 7% fall on the year before, although this does not include fraud figures. The number of fraud offences increased by 8% to 14,845 during the same period. While the number of burglaries (-18%), thefts (-22%) and shoplifting offences fell between September 2019-2020, stalking and harassment reports increased by 11% in Wales, with 36,770 reports. Domestic abuse charities also reported marked increases in calls for help when schools returned in September after abuse was not reported during lockdown. Prof Innes, director of the Crime and Security Research Institute at Cardiff University, said crime had been shifting for years, but lockdown had seemed to accelerated rates of personal and digital crime, as people were stuck at home and spending more time online. Dyfed-Powys Police saw the largest increase in reports of stalking and harassment offences, with 5,229 reports a 34% increase compared to the year before. In North Wales police reported an increase in stalking and harassment crimes, as well as a rise in disability and transphobic hate crime. A BBC investigation has found online scams selling fake protective equipment and coronavirus tests While the coronavirus pandemic has seen many acts of kindness, police have warned some criminals have used Covid-19 to scam people out of their life savings. Figures, published by Action Fraud , show victims of cyber crime and fraud in Wales have reportedly lost £35.4m, with almost 13,000 crimes reported since the start of lockdown on 23 March. Health officials and police have warned scammers claiming to work for the NHS are targeting vulnerable people online offering fake Covid vaccines in return for cash or personal details. Dyfed-Powys Police also reported a significant increase in romance fraud , with victims in west Wales losing £1.3m between January and November last year, with officers saying criminals are targeting the lonely in lockdown. Prof Innes said that empty shops could become hot spots for anti-social behaviour when lockdown was eased Prof Innes said the shift to cyber, such as online hate crime, drug dealing over apps, and smear campaigns, was a huge challenge for forces and they would need to invest in expertise and technology to be able to recover evidence. He said the impact of the pandemic on drug trade, and gang operations like County Lines, was concerning, as criminal operations would have changed. "Just like everybody else has changed their behaviour in the pandemic, those involved in drug behaviour have probably done the same... and probably some of those innovations they've made will stick." At a recent North Wales Police and Crime panel Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said that officers were predicting an increase in "digital cyber criminality" and it would be a "complex and challenging" area for the future. "He would push, shove and kick me out of bed" South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael warned "increased levels of serious violence and domestic abuse were likely to continue" following the pandemic. In a report to the South Wales Police and Crime Panel, Mr Michael said: "The scale of the economic downturn and subsequent rate of recovery will fundamentally shape the post pandemic crime and disorder landscape in the medium to long term." He added: "People are spending more time online - increasing the risk of phishing, grooming, cyber attacks and sextortion. "Payment preferences are also shifting to increasingly be online which again opens up opportunities for online fraud." Meanwhile reports of public order offences also increased across all four forces by 8%, with Dyfed-Powys Police recording an increase of 29% during the year to September 2020. In Dyfed-Powys and Gwent Police areas, documents show the forces said crime had increased after lockdown measures were first eased in summer 2020. In Gwent reports of sexual offences increased by 29% (from 128 to 126), but remained significantly lower than normal with the force saying less people were reporting the crime, while bike thefts increased by 25%, due to "cycling being encouraged...during lockdown". Covid lockdown rule breakers flee Cwmbran salon in police raid In the Dyfed-Powys area drug offences increased during the first lockdown in March , before decreasing significantly later in 2020. The force warned that public tensions remained high due to Covid restrictions, and this had led to the number of reports of public order offences remaining high. There had been "exponential" increases in anti-social behaviour reports due to breaches of lockdown rules, it said. In July and August, when restrictions began to ease, there was a sharp rise in violent attacks, but the force said this was down to an "increase in alcohol related" incidents. In North Wales, by the start of December, officers had issued 582 fines for Covid-19 restriction breaches, with two £10k fines issued for illegal music events. The impact of Covid rule-breakers Prof Innes said when lockdown measures were eased again, anti-social behaviour and low level public disorder could spike in communities, and with people struggling due to losing their jobs, crime levels would return to pre-pandemic levels. "People have been cooped up and there won't be an awful lot of things for people to do as the weather gets nicer," he said. "We can already see some of the social tensions kind of bubbling away when you look across Europe. "Longer term we are going to see a lot of empty shops and town centres are going to be very different than they have been... what we know is when you've got empty stores they act as a magnet for trouble."Alaska phishing pupils take over classroom computers 3 May 2013 At least 18 students took part in the phishing, according to local media A group of pupils at a middle school in Alaska took control of their classroom computers after phishing for administrator privileges. They asked teachers at Schoenbar Middle School, for 12 to 13-year-olds, to enter admin names and passwords to accept a false software update, according to reports. The pupils used those details to access and control classmates' PCs. Classmates then complained that their computers were not responding normally. Associated Press said that at least 18 pupils were involved in the phishing, which gave them control over 300 computers allocated for student use at the school in the Alaskan town of Ketchikan. Those computers have now been seized. "I don't believe any hardware issues were compromised," Casey Robinson, the principal, told community radio station Ketchikan FM . He said: "No software issues were compromised. I don't think there was any personal information compromised. Now that we have all the machines back in our control, nothing new can happen." Mr Robinson added there would be a review of the way that devices are maintained. "How we do business is definitely going to have to change when it comes to updating programs and resources that we have on the machines," Mr Robinson said. "Yes, something new is going to have to happen."Fraudsters 'targeting Christmas online shoppers' 14 November 2020 Fraudsters are exploiting Christmas bargain-hunters who have switched to online shopping owing to coronavirus restrictions. People looking for games consoles, bicycles and clothing may be at a higher risk of encountering a scam, according to banking industry research. UK Finance, which represents the finance industry, warned of scams when items were never delivered. The average loss in such cases was £720 in the first half of the year. 'Ruthless' The trade body said social media platforms, online marketplaces and auction websites were increasingly being used by criminals to carry out these purchase scams, where a customer pays in advance for goods or services that do not exist and are never received. These payments are taken off the integrated payment platform and are made through a bank transfer instead, and mean people are unlikely to be refunded. More than £27m was lost to such fraud in the first half of the year, according to UK Finance figures. It also warned that purchase scams may also involve home improvement and DIY purchases such as patio heaters and sheds, as fraudsters adapted to more people staying at home. Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said: "As consumer spending has shifted online, criminals have ruthlessly adjusted their approaches to pursue those shopping on the internet. "With Black Friday and Christmas approaching, fraudsters are again stepping up their efforts to take advantage of consumers searching for bargains." UK Finance data shows that 25 to 34-year-olds are most likely to shop online regularly. Lockdown cases Ms Worobec said criminals were also using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails. These messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses. The first UK-wide lockdown led to reports of rising numbers of scam and fraud attempts. Figures from Barclays suggested fraud attempts in general were up 66% in the first half of the year compared with the previous six months. How to prevent fraud The Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign is urging people to:Singles Day: The world's biggest shopping event luring scammers By Waiyee Yip 11 November 2020 Singles Day is a shopping event created by Chinese online retailer Alibaba, which rakes in billions of dollars in sales every year Singles Day, the world's biggest online shopping event, has kicked off with consumers estimated to spend billions of dollars - much of which is being eyed by scammers. This year's event is expected to continue to break records across Asia, as more people stay home and shop online amid the Covid-19 pandemic, while those unable to travel overseas for shopping trips are expected to "revenge spend" online. It represents a huge honeypot for scammers who, over the years, have come up with increasingly innovative ways to trick consumers, from creating fake apps to claims of formaldehyde-soaked clothes. Some shoppers in China have lost tens of thousands of dollars to such ruses. What are Chinese police saying this year? Authorities from several provinces including Anhui, Jiangsu and Sichuan have issued warnings on social media platform Weibo about a "fake refund" phone scam. How it works: a person impersonating a customer service officer from an e-commerce site phones the victim to inform him that a recent purchase is either out of stock or damaged, and that as compensation they will give him a refund that is more than the amount that he paid. He then asks the victim for bank account details so that he can "process the refund". Police say they have already seen many such instances in the past few weeks during pre-Singles Day sales. A woman in Yunnan province recently lost a total of 200,000 yuan ($30,000; £22,900) recently after she was tricked into believing that she would be getting a refund on 200 yuan worth of clothes that she bought on e-commerce platform Taobao. She had transferred money to scammers multiple times after being told that there were problems with their system, and that she had to pay to unfreeze her account. What other Singles Day scams have taken place before? The "fake refund" scam has seen various iterations over the years. In 2018, scammers reportedly posed as customer service officers offering refunds on clothes said to be ruined by excessive formaldehyde. One woman in Wuxi city lost 44,000 yuan ($7,000) this way, after she scanned a QR code sent by a scammer which asked for her bank details. Last year, the formaldehyde scam was tweaked to trick mothers into believing that the chemical had tainted their orders of baby diapers. Alibaba Singles Day: Dollars or data? Other scams involve counterfeit shopping apps, which are made to look and function like those by retailers such as Taobao and JD.com. As they look so similar to the real deal, victims are tricked into giving away personal information such as mobile numbers and bank account details. According to a 2018 report by Chinese online security firm 360 Security Brain, close to 4,000 fake shopping apps were downloaded on more than 300,000 mobile devices in China in November that year. Some have been scammed by counterfeit shopping apps, made to look like those by retailers such as Taobao There have also been reports of fraud related to cash-on-delivery packages, where confused family members are asked to pay cash upfront when signing for delivered packages to their door. Why are there so many Singles Day scams? Singles Day is the world's biggest online shopping event in terms of spending, with much of the revenue generated by Chinese online retail giant Alibaba. Last year, their gross merchandise value on Singles Day reached more than 210bn yuan (£23bn, US$31bn), which is double that of Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. This year, Alibaba is claiming to have hit 372bn yuan of sales within the first 30 minutes of the event including pre-Singles Day orders. Originally created by the company as a Chinese shopping festival, it's now expanded across the region with other online retailers in countries such as Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines all holding their own versions. Staff sorting out parcels after Singles Day last year in the Chinese city of Jiujiang Also known as Double 11 as it is held annually on 11 Nov,  the shopping festival offers buyers huge discounts on everything from household items and fashion accessories, to cars and even houses. The huge number of transactions during this period presents scammers with ample opportunities, and e-commerce fraudulent activities saw "significant growth" during the sales period across Asian countries last year, according to data by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. Mr Yeo Siang Tiong, general manager for South East Asia, said victims often fall prey to scams on Singles Day because they get "caught up in the excitement" while trying to get the best deals. "In addition, many of the phishing scams in particular have become quite convincing, making it hard for consumers to differentiate between truth and fiction," he said. What can shoppers do to protect themselves? Never give away critical personal information such as bank account details over the phone. E-commerce platforms such as Taobao would typically have a customer's bank information already saved in their system, so refunds should be able to be processed automatically. Fake refund scams also often offer you more than what you paid for, which would rarely happen in a real situation. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. As for Internet phishing scams, double check web addresses if you are redirected to them from other landing pages, said Kaspersky's Mr Yeo, or try to access deal pages directly through the legitimate website.Home working increases cyber-security fears By David Silverberg and Will Smale 1 February Companies are constantly facing cyber-attacks, and staff working from home can make them more vulnerable Peter says that the cyber-attacks on his company are relentless. "We see tens of different hacking attacks every single week. It is never ending." A senior computer network manager for a global financial services company, Peter (who did not want to give his surname, or the name of his employer, due to his firm's anxieties surrounding cyber-security), says they are bombarded from all directions. "We see everything," he says. "Staff get emails sent to them pretending to be from the service desk, asking them to reset their log-in passwords. "We see workers being tricked into downloading viruses from hackers demanding ransoms, and we have even had employees sent WhatsApp messages pretending to be from the CEO, asking for money transfers. "And having staff working from home during the lockdowns has just made it worse, as it is much harder to keep an eye on everyone." If you thought your cyber-security had been compromised, would you know how to contact your IT department? With one in three UK workers currently based exclusively at home , and the same level in the US , this remote working on a vast scale continues to be a major headache for the IT security bosses of companies large and small around the world. And studies shows that many firms are not taking the issue as seriously as they should. For example, one in five UK home workers has received no training on cyber-security, according to a recent survey by legal firm Hayes Connor Solicitors. The report also found that two out of three employees who printed potentially sensitive work documents at home admitted to putting the papers in their bins without shredding them first. Meanwhile, a separate UK study last year found that 57% of IT decision makers believe that remote workers will expose their firm to the risk of a data breach. "In the rush and panic to set remote working practices up, even simple data protection practices were ignored," says Christine Sabino, a senior associate at Hayes Connor. Christine Sabino fears that in the haste to set up home working, some firms ignored cyber-security issues "Companies did not provide additional security relating to computers, electronic communication, phone communication." So what can both companies and home working staff do to make things as safe and secure as possible? Ted Harrington, a San Diego-based cyber-security specialist, and author of Hackable: How To Do Application Security Right, says firms should have started by giving all home workers a dedicated work laptop. While many larger companies may well have done this, not all smaller firms necessarily have the resources to do so, but Mr Harrington stresses its importance. "Supply staff with laptops and other equipment that are owned, controlled and configured by the company," he says. "This alleviates the burden on your people to set things up right, and ensures they follow the security controls the company wants." Ted Harrington says that workers should not be too scared to report a possible cyber-security breach Definitely don't have staff using their personal computers for work, says Sam Grubb, an Arkansas-based cyber-security consultant, and author of forthcoming book How Cybersecurity Really Works. "The main problem with using your own computer to do work is that you are not limited in what you can do on it, nor are you necessarily the only one that uses it," he says. "So while you might not be visiting a shady website to download movies for free, your teenage son could be doing that exact thing on your home laptop without you even knowing. "This makes it much easier for malware or other attacks to happen. This might affect the work you are doing, or in a worst-case scenario, lead to the compromise of co-workers' devices, or other company devices such as servers." Mr Harrington says that the next step is that companies must set up a VPN or virtual private network, so that remote computers have secure and encrypted connections with the firm's servers and everyone else in the company. Should firms give home workers shredders? Mr Grubb uses a transport and wildlife analogy to explain how VPNs work. "A VPN is like a tunnel between two cities," he says. "Instead of driving through the dark forest full of tigers, lions and bears, you drive through the underground tunnel, where no one can see you driving until you reach your destination on the other side." However, even with work laptops, VPNs and the latest cyber-security software systems in place, staff can still make damaging mistakes, such as falling prey to a "phishing" email - a malicious email pretending to be a legitimate one in order to trick someone into handing over sensitive data. Currently such scam emails doing the rounds include some that are pretending to be informing the targeted person that they have been exposed to Covid-19, or invited to have the vaccine. They ask the recipient to clink on the link, which then tries to download malware onto his or her computer. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. For this reason, both Mr Harrington and Mr Grubb say that it is essential that businesses give staff proper cyber-security training. "Firms should be providing training to help their employees understand the threats they face," says Mr Grubb. Ms Sabino adds that both staff and their bosses need to do their bit. She says, for example, that employees should avoid talking about work on social media, while firms should give shredders to home workers who need to print things out. Harvard University's Tsedal Neeley says that staff need to know who to call in the IT department With even the most cyber-security aware home workers just one click away from making a mistake, Mr Harrington says that firms need policies in place so that staff know who to immediately report a threat to. "If an employee falls victim to an attack, make sure that they know a) who to contact, and b) that their outreach is welcome and won't result in termination," he says. "You don't want people afraid of repercussions and thus covering up mistakes." Tsedal Neeley, a professor of business administration from Harvard Business School who is an expert on remote working, agrees that home workers should know exactly who to report cyber-security problems to. "Engaging with their firm's IT/cyber-security experts is crucial," she says. Peter, the computer network manager, says this engagement should be frequent. "Users should be suspicious of anything that they are not 100% confident about, and it does not hurt to ask your IT department. It is better to check than be compromised."Six arrests in phishing inquiry 9 December 2011 The problems for students surrounded a bogus website Six people have been arrested in connection with a £1m phishing operation that took money from the bank accounts of hundreds of UK students. Students on government loan schemes were targeted and tricked into revealing their bank account details, police said. Some £1,000 to £5,000 was taken at a time, Scotland Yard said. Victims received emails inviting them to update details on their student account via a link to a bogus website. The Metropolitan Police's e-Crime unit was first alerted in August 2011 and worked with the Student Loans Company, the banking industry and internet service providers during their investigation. Officers have now seized computers and other equipment from addresses in London, Manchester and Bolton. A 26-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman have been arrested in Manchester, while a 25-year-old man was arrested in Deptford, south London. A 49-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man were also arrested in Stratford, north-east London, and a 38-year-old man was arrested in Bolton, Lancashire. Phishing is when a legitimate-looking email is sent in an attempt to gather personal and financial information from recipients.'Nightclub bouncer' phishing scam found by researchers 17 January 2013 If your name's not down... you are not getting phished by the criminals behind this attack Cyber-criminals have invented a cunning new method of targeting victims by developing a system that behaves like a bouncer at an exclusive nightclub. Security firm RSA revealed how attackers assigned targets with a unique ID, meaning the scam could be aimed at specific people. If a person's ID was not on the list, their computer would not be affected. RSA said the advanced threat posed a new "detection challenge" to the security industry. In a blog post , RSA cybercrime specialist Limor Kessem wrote: "As we adapt and improve our detection systems, we are reminded that in the never-ending cat-and-mouse game, only the nimble will survive." The so-called Bouncer Phishing Kit targets preset lists of email addresses. For each target, a unique ID is automatically generated, creating a unique web address for the user to click on. If someone has an ID that does not match the list of intended targets, they will simply be presented with a 404 Error page, and will be unharmed. If, however, a person is one of the unfortunate ones, the same page will instead spring into life as an "attack page" ready to steal user credentials. Using this method means attackers can harvest data from certain groups of users, rather than having to sift through large amounts of data. For example, the Bouncer Phishing Kit could be used to gather personal details on people in one particular country. "It holds this [bouncer] moniker because much like many high-profile night-time hotspots - if your name is not on the list, you're staying out," Mr Kessem said. "Traditional phishers like to cast as wide of a net as possible. "But with this tactic the phisher is laser-focusing the campaign in an effort to collect only the most pertinent credentials for his purposes. "Keeping out uninvited guests also means avoiding security companies and prompt take-downs of such attacks." Phishing is a growing problem for internet users. According to RSA's data, attacks of this type were up 59% in 2012 compared with the previous year, and cost the global economy $1.5bn (£940m).Google detects Iran phishing attacks ahead of election 13 June 2013 Google said it had noticed a significant spike in phishing activity in Iran in recent weeks Google says it has detected and stopped thousands of phishing attacks targeting email accounts of Iranian users ahead of the 14 June presidential election. In an online statement, the firm said it had noticed a "significant jump" in the region's overall volume of phishing activity in the last three weeks. The timing and targets suggested the attacks were "politically motivated". Friday's poll is the first since 2009 when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a controversial second term. The election had triggered angry protests, with voters accusing Mr Ahmadinejad's camp of rigging the results in his favour. Fake sign-in page Google's vice-president of security engineering, Eric Grosse, said the phishing attacks originated from within Iran. Phishing attempts to obtain passwords and other private computing information by directing users to fake websites. "For almost three weeks, we have detected and disrupted multiple email-based phishing campaigns aimed at compromising the accounts owned by tens of thousands of Iranian users," he said. "The timing and targeting of the campaigns suggest that the attacks are politically motivated in connection with the Iranian presidential election on Friday." Mr Grosse said victims targeted in the attacks had received an email containing a link to a web page purporting to perform account maintenance. If they clicked the link, they were taken to a fake Google sign-in page, which would steal their username and password. The threat was detected by a phishing detection feature added to the firm's Chrome web browser in 2012. Mr Grosse warned Iranian users to take extra measures to protect their accounts from "state-sponsored attacks". In the latest case, users received a message which appeared to come from Google itself using the official-looking address: email.settings@gmail.com. It suggested they assign an extra email address to their existing Google account to make password recovery easier. The bogus link they were asked to click also contained the search firm's name adding to the appearance of authenticity, Google says. However, the attempt was spotted by a Safe Browsing feature added to Google's Chrome browser last year. Most of the six candidates in Friday's election are conservatives close to Ayatollah Khamenei. The opposition says more than 80 of its supporters were killed in a crackdown over a period of six months after the 2009 election - a figure the government disputes. Several have been sentenced to death, and dozens jailed. The two reformist candidates from 2009 - Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi - remain under house arrest.Three arrested over internet phishing bank scam 30 October 2012 Three men have been arrested in connection with an internet scam targeting online banking customers. The suspects, one from Nigeria and two from Romania, were held at a central London hotel on Monday night. They are are being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering. The arrests followed reports that 2,000 phishing pages, which copy genuine bank sites, were put online to dupe people into entering confidential details. A large number of accounts were then illegally accessed and had money withdrawn. Met Police officers from the Central e-Crime Unit working in partnership with investigators from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) also seized a number of computers. Further searches are ongoing in London and the Midlands.Coronavirus: How hackers are preying on fears of Covid-19 By Joe Tidy 13 March 2020 Comments Security experts say a spike in email scams linked to coronavirus is the worst they have seen in years. Cyber-criminals are targeting individuals as well as industries, including aerospace, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare and insurance. Phishing emails written in English, French, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish languages have been found. The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns. 1. Click here for a cure Victims looking for a cure face having personal details stolen Researchers at the cyber-security firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February. The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments. The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details. It says up to 200,000 of the emails are being sent at a time. "We have seen 35-plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns, with many using fear to convince victims to click," says Sherrod DeGrippo from the company's threat research and detection team. Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day. "It's obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for cyber-criminals," says Ms DeGrippo. The best way to see where a link will take you is to hover your mouse cursor over it to reveal the true web address. If it looks dodgy, don't click. 2. Covid-19 tax refund HM Revenue and Customs is not trying to give you a Covid-19 tax rebate Researchers at cyber-security firm Mimecast flagged this scam a few weeks ago. On the morning they detected it, they saw more than 200 examples in just a few hours. If a member of the public clicked on "access your funds now", it would take them to a fake government webpage, encouraging them to input all their financial and tax information. "Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email," says Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at Mimecast. "And certainly do not click on any links in any related message. This is not how HMRC would advise you of a potential tax refund." 3. Little measure that saves The World Health Organization is being impersonated by many hacking campaigns Hackers pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO) claim that an attached document details how recipients can prevent the disease's spread. "This little measure can save you," they claim. But Proofpoint says the attachment doesn't contain any useful advice, and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger. This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers, a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims' every move online. To avoid this scam, be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO, as they are probably fake. Instead visit its official website or social media channels for the latest advice. 4. The virus is now airborne Hackers are using fear-mongering tactics to encourge clicks and downloads The subject line reads: Covid-19 - now airborne, increased community transmission. It is designed to look like it's from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses one of the organisation's legitimate email addresses, but has in fact been sent via a spoofing tool. Cofense, the cyber-defence provider, first detected the scam and describes it as an example of hackers "weaponising fear and panic". It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page, where people are encouraged to enter their email and password. Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page, making it seem even more authentic.  Of course, the hackers now have control of the email account. Cofense says the combination of a "rather good forgery" and a "high stress situation" make for a potent trap. One way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication, so that you have to enter a code texted or otherwise provided to you, to access your email account. 5. Donate here to help the fight The CDC is not asking for donations in Bitcoin This example was reported to malware experts Kaspersky. The fake CDC email asks for donations to develop a vaccine, and requests payments be made in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The premise is of course ridiculous, but the email address and signature look convincing. Overall, Kaspersky says it has detected more 513 different files with coronavirus in their title, which contain malware. "We expect the numbers to grow, of course, as the real virus continues to spread," says David Emm, principal security researcher at the firm.The computer hackers and phishing experts 'on our side' If you have been hacked it means someone somewhere is watching your computer's every move. Hackers deploy a variety of tricks to gain access to your computer but a fight-back has begun. Some companies are now even paying hackers to test their own firm's security. LJ Rich meets some professional hackers who are on the right side of the law, explains how people go about trying to get inside your computer and has some useful tips on how to stay safe from unwanted invaders.

The website that was put in place by hackers asked users to enter their Apple IDs - the credentials needed to access services like Apple's iTunes. A second screen then asked users to enter further personal information, including credit card details. EA said the problem had been found and hacking attempts had been stopped. Paul Mutton, from Netcraft, the internet security company that uncovered the hack, said in a blog that it was likely a vulnerability in an online calendar application hosted on the web server had been exploited by the attackers. The calendar based on the web server was an old version of software that had since been updated, he said. "The mere presence of old software can often provide sufficient incentive for a hacker to target one system over another, and to spend more time looking for additional vulnerabilities," he wrote. Once a user has entered their Apple ID and password on the fake website they are then asked to verify their name, date of birth, phone number and credit card details among other information. Users were then directed to the legitimate Apple ID website, said Mr Mutton. Users are asked to enter their Apple IDs on the fake website It was reported earlier in the year that other servers belonging to EA had been hacked, causing problems for users trying to log on to online games and services. A hacking group known as Derp posted a tweet claiming responsibility for that attack. Mr Mutton said he had reported the most recent problems to Electronic Arts. In a statement to the BBC, EA said: "We found it, we have isolated it, and we are making sure such attempts are no longer possible." Michael Sutton, from security research firm Zscaler, said that hackers using legitimate websites to host malicious content was now the norm. "Social engineering attacks always involve an element of communication - the victim must be tricked into performing an action such as providing data, clicking on a link, downloading a file, et cetera. Attackers have learned that it's far easier to simply infect an already popular web property than to attempt communication with victims directly," he said. Users should check that websites are secure before entering any private information, says guidance from Get Safe Online. They should look for a padlock symbol in the browser window frame and they should check that the web address begins with https - the "s" stands for secure. The advice also says that users should check the address in the browser's address bar after arriving at a website to check that it matches what they actually typed.Wisconsin Republicans say hackers stole $2.3m 29 October 2020 The Wisconsin hacking reportedly targeted invoices to vendors The Wisconsin Republican party has said hackers stole $2.3m (£1.7m) from the its effort to support President Donald Trump's re-election. The party contacted the FBI and agents are investigating the matter, Chairman Andrew Hitt said in a statement on Thursday. Mr Hitt said the hackers manipulated campaign invoices to steal the funds. In the upcoming presidential election Wisconsin is seen as a key state - one Mr Trump won narrowly in 2016. The party's invoices for vendors were altered so that when they paid the invoices, the money did not go to the vendors, Mr Hitt said. He noted it appeared to have begun as a phishing attempt. A party spokesman said it appeared no data was stolen. The millions were taken from the Wisconsin Republicans' federal account. Mr Hitt said that state officials were warned about such cyberattacks at the party's national convention in August. How could the hackers have done this? Analysis by Joe Tidy, BBC cyber-security reporter The information security world is tense right now waiting and watching for cyber attacks that could affect the US election. This type of attack was probably not on many people's lists of expected hacks. It sounds like an almost standard case of something called Business Email Compromise (BEC). Effectively the hackers have either gained access to or spoofed an email address to put themselves between the Wisconsin Republican party HQ and one of their suppliers. The party then transferred the money to the hackers instead of its campaign partner. In many cases of BEC, banks are able to reverse the transaction and return at least some of the money to the victims. The Republican party will be hoping that this is what happens here. The reported hack comes as Mr Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden are both making a final push this week to secure Wisconsin ahead of the 3 November election. There have also been hundreds of attempted attacks on the Wisconsin Democratic campaign, a spokeswoman told the Associated Press. The Midwestern state is one of a handful of core battleground states - areas which could realistically go to the Republicans or Democrats - this election season. Candidates will need to win in several states like Wisconsin in order to win the presidency. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. Recent polls have consistently shown a tight race, usually with Mr Biden ahead.EasyJet admits data of nine million hacked By Jane Wakefield 19 May 2020 EasyJet has admitted that a "highly sophisticated cyber-attack" has affected approximately nine million customers. It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details "accessed". The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach. EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January. It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April. "This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted," the airline told the BBC. "We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed." Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself. EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks. It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May. It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting "company intellectual property" rather than information that could be used in identity theft. "There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing. "We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays." In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating. "People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary." It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to its advice on its website on how to spot such scams. Phishing Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis. Google is blocking more than 100 million phishing emails every day to Gmail users. It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. "Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on," he said. "Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future. "As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data." 'Turbulent times' The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially. "These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet," said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan. "To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed. "When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record. The British Airways breach in 2018 should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this." British Airways was fined a record £183m over a large data breach in 2018 British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018. Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details. The ICO later issued a record £183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach £3bn. Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover. "It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly," said Aman Johal from law firm Your Lawyers. Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant. Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals. The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card. Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task. Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions. Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages. Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet, banks, or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach. They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves.

Email providers such as Google and Microsoft will work with companies like Paypal and the Bank of America to improve authentication. Phishing attacks typically involve scammers posing as familiar companies in an attempt to trick users into sharing personal information. This co-ordinated effort aims to make this more difficult. The Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMarc) - as the coalition is known - has released plans to produce a "feedback loop" between email receivers and senders. The initiative is the first significant attempt to bring together both email and service providers along with key security organisations. DMarc said this industry-wide involvement - which covers the receivers, senders and intermediaries of email use - will mean email providers will for the first time be able to reliably filter out unwanted emails, rather than use "complex and imperfect measurements" to determine threats. It will mean an agreed standard for authenticating legitimate emails arriving at the inboxes of AOL, Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo customers. It will verify messages from Facebook, Paypal, American Greetings, Bank of America, Fidelity and LinkedIn. Vulnerable "Email phishing defrauds millions of people and companies every year, resulting in a loss of consumer confidence in email and the internet as a whole," explained Paypal's Brett McDowell, chair of DMarc. "Industry co-operation - combined with technology and consumer education - is crucial to fight phishing." Email security firms Agari, Cloudmark, eCert, Return Path and Trusted Domain Project complete the collaboration. More companies will join the open standard as it is developed. Paypal spokesman Rob Skinner explained how the initiative is intended to make things easier for the most vulnerable part of the security chain - the human. Fake emails are obvious to many users, but DMarc hopes to remove the risk of clicking completely "Half the problem is, with the best will in the world and improving technology, ultimately it's still down to the user to decide [to open an email]," he told the BBC. "The key point is trying to block emails from getting to someone's inbox - taking the worry and concern out of people's minds and doing it for them." As one of the internet's most ubiquitous payment companies, Paypal often finds itself impersonated by scammers. "We've acknowledged it's been an issue," Mr Skinner said. "We've had a stack of initiatives over the years to cut down on it. Fraudsters target any company that is well known, has a lot of customers, and operates across the globe. "We recognise our responsibility to do something about it."Fraudsters go phishing for pop music, says producer By Greg Cochrane 31 January 2012 Emeli Sande, Jay-Z and The Ting Tings We usually hear about phishing attacks in the technology world - when impostors try to scam people out of money by tricking them into handing over their personal details. But now it's said the technique has found its way into pop music. Producer Richard X says he's received contact from fraudsters "disguising" themselves as industry workers requesting he sends them music. "They get a little bit of information by searching databases, publishers catalogues or reading forums," says X, sat in his London studio. "That's enough for them to write a cheeky email disguised as someone from the management, touring agency or someone related to the artists in an attempt to get you, the producer, to send them finished tracks or demos." 'Fan-driven' Richard X, who has worked with Kelis, M.I.A. and the original Sugababes, puts this recent development down to the actions of tech-savvy "rabid fans". "You might think that someone wouldn't fall for these emails, but in a high turnover, fast environment, which making records is now, things are needed instantly. It's possible that you would send something," explains X. "I know of a producer recently who did send out the demos and the masters to a random person." Online leaks of music traditionally come from a range of sources - everything from the artist passing new music on to a friend to a journalist leaking a promotional copy or even a producer being careless with a storage hard drive. This development comes as many of the collaborations which regularly fill the top 40 have been recorded without the artists ever having been in the same room. Instead, parts of songs are recorded and exchanged online via email, digital lockers or upload sites. Earlier this month, he tweeted a link to a pop phishing email he'd been sent. "Not to encourage things, but it does seem like an interesting way of trying to get hold of these unreleased gems," he says. "The fan-driven mentality, and rightly so, is that they want to hear new things and will do anything to get the exclusive. I personally don't think it's a big evil piracy network behind it all." Sales threat Whatever the motives, Paul Smernicki, Head of Digital at Universal Records, says it's a broad problem his company is increasingly on the look out for. "People through the label have been made aware to be vigilant," he says. "With that particular method, the intent can only be interpreted as malicious." He says music leaking online from his artists (Universal - the world's biggest record label looks after everyone from Lady Gaga to Take That) is a "relatively frequent" occurrence. "If someone walked up to you in the street dressed as a policeman and tried to get you to do something, that would be pretty shocking," says Smernicki. "The ingenuity is surprising, but not the intent." He says pop phishing is among the acts of fraudsters who "really want to damage an album campaign" and that if music fans can get access to tracks for free, it could hurt sales. "Some people, lots of people, may not go and buy the album," he says. "People invest loads of time, energy and emotion into doing their jobs and doing them as well as they possibly can. To have the rug pulled out from under is really hard." He says security can be an issue and points to Jay-Z and Kanye West's Watch The Throne album as an "extreme example" of artists taking music protection into their own hands. The rappers held tracks on fingerprint-protected hard drives and recorded in pop-up studios in international hotel rooms. Artists' view From it being mastered to it hitting shelves, it's not unusual for a track or an album to be sat waiting for months. Brits Critics Choice winner Emeli Sandé finished her debut album last year, but it doesn't get released until 13 February. She says she hoped it wouldn't leak, but that it feels "almost like an inevitability now that someone will find it and it will get out". "It's a real shame if it affects actual sales," Sandé told Newsbeat. "People don't understand how much work goes into making a record. How much time and how hard it is to even get it released. I feel quite upset that it happens." The Ting Tings' second album, Sounds From Nowheresville, has already appeared online despite not being released until March. Multi-instrumentalist with the Salford band, Jules de Martino, takes a different view. "Art should always have a price. I'm not a big fan of people stealing stuff, even if it's a penny," he explains. "But if you're doing your stuff honestly, creatively and it's good, then I think you will stay in the game as long as you can - sales apart. "If you're doing all right that price comes back because you're selling it in another form, whether it's tickets, T-shirts or records."'Spam capital' India arrests six in phishing probe 8 March 2012 Every month, Indians are adopting the internet in their millions - but growth is attracting crime Police in India say they have arrested six foreign nationals suspected of defrauding hundreds of people using text message and email scams. Scam victims were duped after being told they had won a lottery. Authorities seized 14 laptops, seven memory sticks and 23 mobile phones, as well as fake documents and cash. The arrests come after security firm Kaspersky reported that India now sent more spam than any other country in the world. Police said the six men, all Nigerian, would be remanded in custody until 12 January. The arrests signal attempts to crack down on a growing cybercrime problem in the region. Mumbai-based internet security specialist Vijay Mukhi said poor enforcement of laws meant spammers could act with impunity. "We have an Information Technology Act that was introduced in 2000. But we don't have any convictions under it and it's silent on spam," he said. "If I'm a spammer, I would rather spam from India to India and the rest of world because nothing will happen to me." Free rein In its report, Kaspersky said 14.8% of all spam email sent in the three months prior to the end of September had originated in India. Darya Gudhova, Kaspersky's spam analyst, said a lack of security awareness had given spammers free rein. She added that there was a growing level of cybercrime activity in developing regions such as Asia and Latin America. The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI) estimates that the country has more than 112 million internet users, the third largest in the world after the US and China. About seven million new users are being added every month, the IMAI said. David Emm, a security researcher from Kaspersky Labs, said this growth was making life difficult for the authorities - but believed the arrests signalled a strong sign of intent from the Indian government to get a grip on scammers. "One of the good things is that they are taking it as a serious issue," he told the BBC. "Cybercrime activity is breaking out of the western European theatre and starting to affect other parts of the globe because of the massive growth in IT. "[In Europe] we've had cybercrime legislation for a long time with lots of expertise and history of dealing with it - but if you go to other areas like Brazil or India, you find they don't necessarily have specific cybercrime legislation."Coronavirus: Russian spies target Covid-19 vaccine research By Chris Fox & Leo Kelion 16 July 2020 Russian spies are targeting organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine in the UK, US and Canada, security services have warned. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the hackers "almost certainly" operated as "part of Russian intelligence services". It did not specify which organisations had been targeted, or whether any information had been stolen. But it said vaccine research had not been hindered by the hackers. Russia has denied responsibility. "We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain. We can say one thing - Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts," said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, according to the Tass news agency. The warning was published by an international group of security services: One expert said it was "plausible" that, despite the Kremlin's denials, Russian spies were involved. "The received wisdom is that in cyber-space, attribution is difficult but not impossible," commented Emily Taylor from the Chatham House think tank. "Usually the security services are much more hedgy in their language if they think there is any doubt. "Cozy Bear [the named group] has been implicated in past cyber-attacks and has left quite a trail, and there are fairly good links to the Russian state itself." In recent years, Western security agencies have become more willing to call out hackers targeting companies and organisations in their countries in the hope it will deter them. But the latest accusations are more unusual since officials are directly pointing the finger at Russian spies rather than talking generally about "state-backed hackers" or using other more cautious references. And they are also challenging them over targeting something that the general public recognises as being highly sensitive - coronavirus vaccine research - rather than simply some company or government department's information. However, on another level we should not be too surprised by the claim. Understanding vaccine research and other details about the pandemic has become a top target for intelligence agencies around the world and many others, including Western spies, are likely to be active in this space. The UK, US and Canadian agencies said the hackers had exploited software flaws to get access to vulnerable computer systems, and had used malware called WellMess and WellMail to upload and download files from infected machines. They are also said to have tricked individuals into handing over login credentials with spear-phishing attacks. But one cyber-security expert said the Russians were unlikely to be the only ones involved in such a campaign. "They have lots of people, we have lots of people, the Americans have even more people, as do the Chinese," commented Prof Ross Anderson from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory. "They are all trying to steal this kind of stuff all the time." Who is accused of being responsible? The NCSC calls out a hacking group called APT29, also known as The Dukes or Cozy Bear. It says it is more than 95% certain that the group is part of the Russian intelligence services. Cozy Bear was first identified as being a significant "threat actor" in 2014, according to the American cyber-security firm Crowdstrike. It describes the group as being "aggressive" in its tactics and "nothing if not flexible, changing tool sets frequently". The unit has previously been implicated in hacking the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the US Presidential election in 2016. In 2017, it attacked Norway's Labour Party , defence and foreign ministries, as well as the country's national security service. The report includes recommendations that can help protect organisations from cyber-attacks . "Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of Covid-19 vaccines," it said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: "It is completely unacceptable that the Russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic. "While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health." On Thursday, the UK government also said Russians had "almost certainly" sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly-acquired documents. "We worked very closely with our allies to ensure we would take measures to keep that information safe," said White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, "and we continue to do so and we are aware of those activities." What else has the US said? by Tara McKelvey in Washington DC "The National Security Agency, along with our partners, remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting national security by collectively issuing this critical cyber-security advisory as foreign actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic," said NSA cyber-security director Anne Neuberger. Earlier in 2020, John Demers, an assistant attorney general for US national security, warned that hackers working for foreign governments were trying to steal vaccine research. He said that the first nation to find a vaccine first will gain clout on the world stage with a "significant geopolitical success story". For that reason, hackers have been pursuing vaccine research in several countries. Demers and others who work in US intelligence have been watching their activities closely. Now, intelligence experts know more about the goals of the hackers and how they using spear-phishing and malware to get what they want.Student phishing scam: Two men remanded over fraud 10 December 2011 Two men have been charged over a £1m email scam which took money from the bank accounts of hundreds of students. Police said students on government loans were sent phishing emails urging them to provide their banking details. Damola Olatunji, 26, of Hamsterley Avenue, Manchester, and Amos Mwangi, 25, of Rochdale Way, Deptford, London, face a charge of conspiracy to defraud. They were remanded in custody until 17 February by Westminster Magistrates' Court, central London. Their next appearance is due to be at Southwark Crown Court in south-east London. Mr Olatunji is also charged with possession of an article for use in fraud. Further arrests Five other people arrested in the investigation have been bailed until March pending further inquiries. They are a 25-year-old woman arrested in Manchester, a 49-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man held in Stratford, north-east London. Two men, aged 38 and 35, were also detained in Bolton, Greater Manchester. They were all arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and money-laundering offences and bailed until March. The Metropolitan Police's e-crime unit was first alerted to the scam in August and worked with the Student Loans Company, the banking industry and internet service providers during its investigation. Phishing is the sending of a legitimate-looking email in an attempt to gather personal and financial information from recipients.Scammers target more than 40 people in NI in two days 19 April 2020 Chief Superintendent Simon Walls says parents should keep an eye on their child's online activity Fraudsters "will stop at nothing to dupe people, even during the global Covid-19 pandemic", a senior police officer has said. It comes after more than 40 cyber scams were reported to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) between Thursday and Sunday. The majority of the reports involved "sextortion". "Sextortion" occurs when scammers threaten to publish indecent images of their victim. The PSNI say the criminals have been targeting people from counties Antrim, Down, Tyrone and Londonderry. Phishing emails "Scammers are ruthless, unscrupulous individuals who don't care about the impact of their actions on victims, which can sometimes be life changing and which often have a significant impact," said Mr Walls. "All scammers care about is getting money from their victims.” He said most of the reports made to police involve an email which says that if the recipient does not pay £2,000 then indecent images of the person will be released. Others are phishing emails in which the scammers claim to know the recipient's passwords and will share images of the person if they do not pay a fee. Police are urging people not to be duped by fraudsters attempting to swindle them There have also been reports of people being targeted over the phone. “It's really important that parents and guardians know what their loved ones' online activity is, who their children are engaging with and what sites they are visiting," added Mr Walls. "It's also important people have a conversation with their loved ones, and with each other, so they are aware of the extraordinary lengths scammers will go to and the abhorrent tactics they will employ."Woolworths High Street 'relaunch' proves a hoax By Jane Wakefield 27 October 2020 Woolworths closed its doors for good in 2008, owing £385m A tweet announcing the relaunch of UK High Street retailer Woolworths has gone viral, despite being fake. The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which has now been deleted, misspelled the shop's name. And it linked to a website that was not active and had, BBC News has learned, been registered only hours earlier. Metro, which appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news, has now corrected its story. Pic'n'Mix-up Very, the company that owns the local rights to the Woolworths brand, confirmed it was a hoax. "We own the Woolworths trademark in the UK," a spokesman told BBC News. "The Twitter account UKWoolworths is not connected to the Very group." The original tweet read: "Here to save 2020. "Woolworths is coming back to your High Street, as a physical store. "A couple of legal things to get sorted but we're full steam ahead at Woolworths HQ. "We want to get this right, so we need your help. "What do you want at your UK #YourWoolworths?" Metro appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news Ray Walsh, scam expert at virtual private network (VPN) company ProPrivacy, said: "It's not unsurprising that huge numbers of people around the UK have fallen for fake news surrounding the reopening of Woolworths. "The brand was a much-loved part of UK shopping history. "And many have fond memories of the retailer. "But the Twitter account spreading the hoax was full of typos and spelling mistakes. "This alone should have been enough to make it obvious that something extremely fishy was going on. "The important take away from all of this is how social engineering and nostalgia can be used to trick people. "And it serves as an important reminder of why people need to think carefully when using the internet to avoid falling for scams and phishing attacks." The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which now has more than 4,000 followers, misspelled the shop's name Woolworths closed its doors for good in 2008, owing £385m. The shops, famous for their Pic'n'Mix sweets, also sold kitchen and garden equipment and toys. One of the UK's oldest chains it had 815 stores, many of which were taken over by shops such as Wilko and Poundland. The Woolworths name remains in use in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as an unrelated retail brand. This was the fake news story 2020 needed - and it might seem less important than harmful coronavirus conspiracy theories or political disinformation, which have spread on wildfire on social media in recent months. But it does teach us some important lessons about how and why disinformation spreads on social media. We tend to share posts that we want to be true or that confirm our biases - who isn't missing Woolworth's pic'n'mix, especially during a pandemic? That partly explains why the tweet from the fake Woolworth's account - which kept spelling the name of the chain wrong - went so viral. But it also highlights the need for verification - and the role of the media in amplifying disinformation. A quick ring around would have confirmed that Woolworth's is not re-opening - but that did not stop a number of news outlets covering this fake Twitter account.Dark web scammers exploit Covid-19 fear and doubt By Sooraj Shah 19 May 2020 "They're exploiting the fear, uncertainty and doubt people are experiencing during the pandemic, and using the anxiety and desperation to get people to buy things or click on things they wouldn't have otherwise," says Morgan Wright, a former senior adviser to the US Department of State anti-terrorism assistance programme. He's talking about the scammers and criminals that inhabit the "dark web" who have found a new angle - anxiety over Covid-19. Mr Wright, who is now chief security adviser at security software company SentinelOne, used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency (NSA) about the exploitation of human behaviour. He is now seeing some of those techniques being used on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet that can be accessed using popular networks such as Tor. The Tor browser is privacy-focused, meaning it can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed. It offers bad actors a way to operate with a degree of impunity, as law enforcement find it much more difficult to track down criminals that use it. Mr Wright used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency (NSA) What is Tor? Tor is a way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor browser, to use it. The name is an acronym for The Onion Router. Just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network. It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department. It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several "nodes" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points. Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity. To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an "exit node" - rather than the person responsible. Since the beginning of the global pandemic, marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in Covid-19 related products and services. Sought-after N95 masks, gowns, gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces. Last month, security software firm IntSights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale. Criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products, and as a result these items are not cheap; an Australian Institute of Criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about $370 (£300), while one supposedly sourced from China was selling for between $10-15,000 (£8-12,000). One of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web - such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles - because these industries are currently dormant. Many criminals also see an opportunity - as the majority of people are working from home, there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place. "There was suddenly a huge shift [on the dark web] of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home," says IntSights chief security officer Etay Maor. More Technology of Business Phishing scams have also been on the rise. These are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email, hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data, which can then be used to steal money or someone's identity. "The phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the NHS, and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to Covid-19 like banks or HMRC emailing about funding, grants or being furloughed," says Javvad Malik, security advocate at training company KnowBe4. "Now there are Covid-19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the phishing kits that are available on the dark web - meaning people can imitate Apple or LinkedIn with a set of standard templates," he adds. In addition, many services and products, including phishing kits are being offered at discount in "coronavirus sales". "There are people who have been specialising in phishing pages, shady VPNs or spamming services for a number of years, who are now offering discounts because they believe it's the best time to make money and spread these kits," says Liv Rowley, threat intelligence analyst at Blueliv, a computer and network security firm. Intelligence analyst Liv Rowley monitors dark web scammers The dark web was designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, with the idea of enabling human rights activists and people within the military to talk and collaborate in a secure, anonymous way. While the introduction of bitcoin enabled criminals to make money on the dark web, there remains a huge number of users that opt to use it for its initial purpose - speaking to others anonymously on forums. According to Mr Malik, these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus. "Conspiracies about 5G being the vehicle of this virus, or bioweaponry or that Bill Gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web," he says. As social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation, many others may be pushed onto the dark web. These forums often act as a gateway to marketplaces, for people to plug their products or services to a targeted audience. This could be a way for fraudsters to make further money in the months to come. Conspiracy theories flourish on the dark web, says Javvad Malik The flipside to this is that many journalists, activists and citizens may be using the dark web to communicate in countries where there is a lot of censorship. Tor versions of many news outlets, including the BBC and New York Times, may be used if the original sites are blocked by governments or states, for instance. Netblocks, a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways, as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak. Two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic, but as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined in a recent press briefing, there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic - including hospitals. "These organisations are targeted because of how vulnerable they are at this time and because of the likelihood that a ransom would be paid," says Charity Wright, cyber threat intelligence adviser at IntSights. The co-ordination and orchestration of many of these attacks often begin on the dark web. Dark Web scammers are targeting healthcare, says Etay Maor "We are seeing more offerings on the dark web specifically for healthcare-related information and for targeting healthcare facilities and doctors. There's even a database someone has created on the dark web with all kinds of information about medical staff," says Etay Maor from IntSights. At its core, the dark web may still be being used for the same reasons it was intended to be used for - from a privacy and security perspective. But criminals are using this to try to exploit a global crisis for financial gain. "That's the double-edged sword that as a society we haven't quite worked out: how do we safeguard freedom of speech and ensure privacy, but at the same time track down and stop people abusing those freedoms?" says Javvad Malik.Some Xbox Live users targeted in online phishing scam By Del Crookes and Dan Whitworth 22 November 2011 Xbox Live users are being urged to check their accounts after some say they were scammed by a fake email. The phishing attack sent users to a fake site where they were asked to input personal details like addresses, emails and credit card details. Microsoft is investigating and says a small percentage of users are affected. "We take the security of the Xbox Live service seriously and work to improve it against evolving threats," a Microsoft spokesman said. "Very occasionally, though, we are contacted by members regarding alleged unauthorized access to their accounts by outside individuals." The spokesman continued: "We can confirm that only a small percentage of Xbox Live customers have been affected here in the UK. "We work closely with impacted members directly to resolve any unauthorized changes to their accounts and, as always, highly recommend all Xbox Live users follow our account security guidance in order to protect their account details." Microsoft confirmed there had been no breach in the security of Xbox Live itself. The company says there is advice on its website about staying safe online but advises that people should never give out passwords or email addresses. It says users should never type personal information into websites unless they are sure that they are genuine. Jason Hart, MD of Cryptocard and a former ethical hacker, said: "Xbox customers are finding that they might have had more than £100 pilfered from their accounts. "This is the third instance of hacking to hit the gaming industry in as many months and it is clear that hackers are finding it all too easy to steal gamers' identities and access the financial information they need to make off with users cash."Facebook works with Websense to add phishing safety net 3 October 2011 Users will see this notice if they are about to visit a potentially harmful website, giving them the option to go back to the previous page Facebook have stepped up their battle against phishing and malware scammers by partnering with security firm Websense. As of next week, users will be warned if they are about to be taken to a malicious website. The social network has suffered to date as many of its 700 million users unwittingly click on dangerous links supposedly posted by their friends. Such attacks usually trick users into sharing passwords or data. Facebook already tells users if they are about to visit an external site, but the current set up makes no distinction between friendly and dangerous sites. The new technology will present a warning screen whenever it suspects a page poses a threat to the users, giving details of the risk. From here, users are encouraged to return to the previous page. If they wish, users can continue to the intended page, albeit very much at their own risk. 'Profitable target' Both Facebook and Websense will hope the extra measures will be enough to deter potential scammers from focusing their efforts on the network. Scams regularly catch out hundreds of thousands of users at a time. "There's over 700 million users on Facebook," Websense's Spencer Parker told the BBC. "As a piece of real estate, it's extremely profitable to be targeted by malware writers." The protection will be powered by Websense's "Threatseeker Cloud", a system which stores a database of known malicious URLs. The system can also detect unknown dangerous URLs by assessing threats in real-time. This means harmful URLs can be blocked even before they are known to the company - cutting off a key tactic used by phishers in which constantly changing URLs fool database-driven protection. In addition, the system will "follow" links made using popular URL shorteners - such as bit.ly and ow.ly - to verify their safety. Due to the nature of how we interact with our friends, Mr Parker says phishing attacks on Facebook are much harder to prevent than other commonly used techniques. "One of the things with Facebook, of course, is that you have that element of trust in a social network. If one of your friends posts something, you automatically trust it more than if it just received as a spam email. "As more of these 'friend in the middle' attacks happen, you start to trust your friends less."Twitter hack: Bognor Regis man one of three charged 31 July 2020 Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian and Barack Obama are among victims of the hack A man living in Bognor Regis - on the UK south coast - is one of three individuals charged over a major Twitter hack, according to the US Department of Justice. Californian authorities filed felony charges against Mason Sheppard, 19. The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) confirmed it had searched a property in Bognor Regis with police on Friday. A teenager in Tampa and Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, were also charged in Florida. US Attorney David L Anderson said the arrests proved "nefarious hacking... for fun or profit" did not pay off. Twitter accounts of multiple high-profile US figures were hijacked in an apparent Bitcoin scam on 15 July. They included former President Barack Obama, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, entrepreneur Elon Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and reality star Kim Kardashian West, who all falsely tweeted out requests for Bitcoin donations. In his statement, US Attorney Anderson said: "There is a false belief within the criminal hacker community that attacks like the Twitter hack can be perpetrated anonymously and without consequence." He added: "Criminal conduct over the Internet may feel stealthy to the people who perpetrate it, but there is nothing stealthy about it.  In particular, I want to say to would-be offenders, break the law, and we will find you." In Florida, Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren filed 30 felony charges against the teenager, 17, who cannot be named, for "scamming people across America". The charges include organised fraud and fraudulent use of personal information. "As a crypto-currency, Bitcoin is difficult to track and recover if stolen in a scam," Mr Warren said. "These crimes were perpetrated using the names of famous people and celebrities, but they're not the primary victims here. This 'Bit-Con' was designed to steal money from regular Americans from all over the country, including here in Florida. "This massive fraud was orchestrated right here in our backyard, and we will not stand for that." Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Barack Obama were all 'hacked' The charges against the teenager include 17 counts of communication fraud, 10 counts of fraudulent use of personal information, one count of fraudulent use of personal information with over $100,000 (£76,340) or 30 or more victims, one count of organised fraud and one count of access to computers or electronic devices without authority. "He's a 17 year-old kid who apparently just graduated high school," said State Attorney Warren. "But no make no mistake, this was not an ordinary 17-year-old. This was a highly sophisticated attack on a magnitude not seen before." He added that the investigation to "discover the perpetrator" was a collaboration between the Florida Department of Law enforcement, the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the FBI , the IRS, and the Secret Service. The teenager lives in Tampa, Florida and so will be prosecuted by Hillsborough State authorities. Twitter said in a statement: "We appreciate the swift actions of law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to cooperate as the case progresses. "For our part, we are focused on being transparent and providing updates regularly." After the hack, Twitter said the hackers had targeted its employees "with access to internal systems and tools". It added that "significant steps" had been taken to limit access to such internal systems and tools while the company's investigation continued. According to BBC cyber-security reporter Joe Tidy, the consensus in the information security community is that Twitter's employees were likely duped by a spear-phishing attack via a phone call. This involves using friendly persuasion and trickery to get victims to hand over crucial information that enables hackers to infiltrate a company's systems.
